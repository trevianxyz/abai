    body: "Kazakh Khanate: Diamond Sword tells the history of fifteenth century Eurasia. For several centuries, this region was largely ruled by descendants of the great Genghis Khan. One of them, Abulkhair Shaibani, usurped power in the White Horde. The two legitimate heirs to the throne - Kerey and Zhanibek - urge their nomadic tribes to leave the despotic ruler. In search of freedom and a better life, the nomads follow the two Sultans, facing bloody battles, hardships, bitter losses, and the joy of victory. Ultimately, a new ethnic group emerges in the Great Steppe - the Kazakhs, along with their new state, the Kazakh Khanate.<br>Embassy of Kazakhstan and Central Asia program of IERES cordially invite you to attend the screening of the film: Kazakh Khanate: Diamond Sword"
