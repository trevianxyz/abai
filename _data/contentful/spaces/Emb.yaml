  title: Foreign Policy
  body: "Kazakhstan’s foreign policy is based on the understanding that it is a large
    country with roots in both Europe and Asia. Kazakhstan’s location and nomadic
    heritage and commercial history of the Silk Road has helped to guide a multi-vectored
    foreign-policy and economic diplomacy.\n\nPresident Tokayev has carried on the
    multi-vectored doctrine that First President Nursultan Nazarbayev implemented
    during his presidency.  Both leaders believe that by enacting strong political
    and economic reforms, the country will be in a better position to build its relationships
    with other nations. Kazakhstan is an impartial nation, one that has worked hard
    to reform its military, political and economic policies as it advances toward
    a full democracy. Kazakhstan's foreign policy underscores a commitment to strong,
    long-lasting alliances, partnerships, and friendships based on mutual respect
    - as is consistent with nomadic legacy.  \n\nKazakhstan has many foreign policy
    and diplomatic accomplishments in its short time as an independent nation."

    title: Nuclear Nonproliferation & Security
    body: "All facets of modern Kazakhstan and national identity have been shaped
      by its [history](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/kazakhstan-nuclear-disarmament/)with
      nuclear weapons. The lives of all Kazakhs have in some way been singed by nuclear
      testing. The former Soviet Union treated Kazakh soil as a nuclear testing ground
      and conducted as many as 460 nuclear tests. \n\nKazakhstan inherited upon independence
      more than 1400 nuclear weapons, and President Nazarbayev quickly moved to decommission
      each warhead and tactical weapon. Today Kazakhstan stands as an clear example
      of how a nation can obtain economic prosperity and national security without
      nuclear weapons, rather than with them. \n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan’s contribution
      to the nuclear disarmament program demonstrates its commitment to the objectives
      of global security, establishing Kazakhstan as a critical member of the world
      community.  \n\n<div class=\"usa-alert usa-alert-info\">\n<div class=\"usa-alert-body\">\n<h3
      class=\"usa-alert-heading\">Nuclear Threat Initiative; Washington, D.C</h3>\n<p
      class=\"usa-alert-text\">Kazakhstan’s experience in disarming itself of nuclear
      weapons following the fall of the Soviet Union could serve as a model for other
      countries, most notably Iran. During a symposium held here on Capitol Hill,
      Kazakh and U.S. officials, former officials and other experts detailed Kazakhstan’s
      transformation during the 1990s from a newly independent country possessing
      one of the world’s largest nuclear arsenals to one that renounced nuclear weapons
      and has since worked to dismantle its Soviet-era WMD architecture with U.S.
      assistance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n    \nOn the 29th of December 1991, the leaders
      of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine signed the Almaty Declaration, in
      which they agreed on the control mechanisms over the operation of the nuclear
      arsenal of the former USSR and affirmed their international obligations concerning
      the strategic arms reduction.\n\nOn the 23rd of May 1992, in Lisbon the representatives
      of Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and USA signed a five party Protocol
      to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. At the same time Belarus, Ukraine and
      Kazakhstan, as the states possessing nuclear weapons, committed themselves to
      the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thus Kazakhstan has made a historical decision
      to renounce its nuclear heritage which was an important step strengthening the
      statehood of our country as an integral part of existing world civilization.\n\nIn
      accordance with the Lisbon Protocol, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine, as successor
      states to the USSR in terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, have agreed
      to participate, along with Russia and USA, in the work of the joint Commission
      on observance and inspection. They have also agreed to conclude agreements on
      the limits and restrictions specified by the Treaty. Kazakhstan ratified the
      Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, which is an integral part of the Treaty, on
      the 2nd of July 1992. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty came into force in
      1994 and paved the way to disarmament and the elimination of more than 9,000
      nuclear warheads under strict supervision.\n\nKazakhstan was the first among
      the participants of the Lisbon Protocol to implement the provisions concerning
      removal of nuclear warheads. On the 21st of April 1996 the process of removal
      of 1416 nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan territory was completed. On the 30th
      of May 1995 the last nuclear test warhead, which was located in a gallery on
      the Semipalatinsk test site, was destroyed. Finally Kazakhstan had got rid of
      its nuclear inheritance forever.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, Kazakhstan was the
      site of the world’s fourth largest nuclear arsenal of more than 1000 deadly
      ICBMs which posed a menacing, if not dangerous, threat to international peace,
      depending on the leadership and direction of that country when it became independent
      in 1991. Fortunately, that leader was President Nursultan Nazarbayev who acted
      decisively to order the dismantling and removal of the country’s entire nuclear
      weapons system. \n\nIn 1994, Kazakhstan transferred more than a half-ton of
      weapons-grade uranium to the U.S. In 1995, Kazakhstan removed its last nuclear
      warhead and, with U.S. assistance, completed the sealing of 181 nuclear test
      tunnels in May 2000. Kazakhstan has signed the START Treaty (1992), the Nuclear
      Non-Proliferation Treaty (1993), the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive
      Test Ban Treaty (2001).\n\nOn March, 21, 2009 the Treaty on Nuclear Weapon Free
      Zone in Central Asia, signed on September, 8, 2006 in Semei, Kazakhstan, went
      into force. Kazakhstan welcomes the Treaty’s becoming effective and believes
      that it will contribute to global non-proliferation process and promote regional
      and international security. The new denuclearized zone in Central Asia has a
      number of unique features. First, one of the zone’s state namely, Kazakhstan,
      in the past possessed the forth largest nuclear arsenal. Secondly, for the first
      time the denuclearized zone is created in Northern hemisphere. Thirdly, this
      Treaty becomes the first multilateral agreement in security area which brings
      together all five Central Asian countries. And finally, for the first time the
      denuclearized zone has been created in the region which borders upon two nuclear
      states. The Protocol on negative security assurances is an integral part of
      the Treaty. Under the Protocol, the nuclear weapon states pledge not to use
      or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any states member to the Treaty.\n\nOn
      June 18, 2009 over 25,000 locals, Kazakh dignitaries and world media gathered
      in Semey city to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's decision to
      stop nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site. The meeting was held in Semey
      where President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed an appeal to the international
      community to back up the peaceful mission of Kazakhstan. In his speech, President
      Nazarbayev emphasized that refusal to conduct nuclear testing has become possible
      due to courage and enthusiasm of millions of Kazakhs that put an end to the
      crimes against lives and health of the whole people of Kazakhstan. Besides he
      noted that “starting from the first days of the country’s independence, Kazakhstan
      did not leave its citizens alone with their problems. The work on social rehabilitation
      of the population and the territories suffered the harm of the nuclear tests
      is being constantly carried out. For these purposes the state utilized nearly
      KZT 34 billion (approximately $215 million)”.\n\nIn December 2009, the UN General
      Assembly unanimously accepted a resolution put forward by Kazakhstan proclaiming
      August 29, the day when in 1991 President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree
      on the closure of Semipalatinsk Test Site, as the ‘International Day against
      Nuclear Tests’. Recognizing the negative impact of nuclear testing on human
      life and the environment, as well as the importance of ending nuclear tests
      as one of the key means of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world, the Resolution
      sets out to commemorate a significant date in Kazakhstan’s – and, indeed, -
      the world’s history.\n\nThe international community has fully appreciated Kazakhstan’s
      contribution to this nuclear disarmament program. Paying a visit to Kazakhstan
      in April 2010 U.N. Secretary General Ban Kim-moon said “I highly commend the
      extraordinary leadership of president Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who courageously
      closed this nuclear test site and initiated the nuclear weapon-free zone in
      Central Asia. That’s a big milestone”.\n\nDuring the Nuclear Security Summit
      in Washington, D.C. in April, 2010 Obama praised President Nazarbayev \"as really
      one of the model leaders in the world on nonproliferation and nuclear-safety
      issues\". U.S. President B. Obama and other leaders also took positive view
      on President Nazarbayev's proposition to establish an International Nuclear
      Fuel Bank on the Kazakh territory. President Nazarbayev highly appraised the
      antinuclear initiatives and achievements of the U.S. President in ensuring international
      security, namely, convocation of the Global Nuclear Security Summit, signing
      the New START Treaty with Russia, adoption of the new US nuclear posture review
      which had become a great step towards establishment of the nuclear-free world.\n\n "

        with them. Since becoming an independent nation, Kazakhstan has been a leader

        Kazakhstan is a participatory member of the United Nations, and fully supportive of the three main pillars of the United Nations - international peace and security, human well-being and humanitarian action, and sustainable development. 

        The Preamble to the Charter spells out that the United Nations was founded "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war". Kazakhstan is uniquely positioned to carry out this charter because of direct experiences in nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, protecting economic and social rights. Kazakhstan shares the imperative to make the Earth habitable for future generations free of conflicts stemming from food, water and energy crises. 

        Kazakhstan is transforming the city of Almaty into a sub-regional multilateral diplomacy and humanitarian hub with focus to enhance United Nations operations in the region and beyond.

      body: |
        Kazakhstan’s work with the OSCE has been broad and consistent to strengthen inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels. In its role as the 2010 OSCE Chairman-in-Office (CiO), the Republic of Kazakhstan followed the “Ministerial Troika” and a  “Quintet” format. Kazakhstan, the first non-European CiO, and paid specific attention to its Chairmanship agenda to the longstanding OSCE priorities, Democracy, Human rights, and Unresolved Conflicts. At the same time, Kazakhstan introduced its own agenda: 

        - __Security__ – Strengthening security in Central Asia is one of the most important priorities of Kazakhstan’s efforts within the OSCE. In addition, Kosovo’s independence can potentially help end unresolved conflicts in Transcaucasia (Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia) and other European regions (Crimea, Moldavia).
        - __Inter-religious tolerance__ – Kazakhstan will enhance international laws that strengthen inter-religious and ethnic tolerance within the OSCE’s zone of responsibility. Foreign Minister Tazhin’s 2008 commitments to cooperate with the OIC and OSCE also illustrate Kazakhstan’s determination in strengthening inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels.
        - __Energy security__ – In support of the European Union energy security agenda, Kazakhstan will strengthen alternative energy. This corresponds with the United States’ policies of energy security, such as the Clean Technology Fund, that focus on alternative energy and the development of clean energy technologies.

        background __\n\nThe idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President
        of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of
        the United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish
        an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the
        region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the
        world, for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier
        attempts for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the
        idea of convocation of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian
        states defining the political climate on the continent, and the international
        organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization
        of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings of the representatives of Foreign
        Ministries of Asian states were held. Following the results of the given meetings
        a Special Working Group (SWG) was established. The task of the Group includes
        preparation of documents for the meeting.\n\nPreparatory process. In 1993-1994
        during the meetings of the representatives of the Asian countries’ MFA drafts
        of the CICA basic documents, i.e. “Rules of Procedure of the CICA”, “Declaration
        of the principles of mutual relations of the CICA Member States”, “Structure
        and institutions of the CICA”, were considered.  In 1996-1997, in Almaty,
        two meetings of Deputy Foreign Ministers of the CICA Member States were held.\nIn
        October 1998, in Almaty the international colloquium on the CICA issues, which
        was attended by 24 experts from 12 States took place. \n\n__The First CICA
        Ministerial Meeting__\n\nOn September 14, 1999 the First Ministerial Meeting
        was held. During this meeting the Declaration, regulating relations between
        the Member States of the meeting – a kind of a prototype of the legal framework
        for establishment of Asian security and cooperation system was signed.\n\nThus,
        for the first time the legal framework of the Asian security, with specific
        actions, measures and mechanisms to ensure stability in the region were laid.
        The First CICA Summit. On June 4, 2002 __the First summit of the Forum__,
        which brought together the heads of Kazakhstan, Russia, China, Pakistan, Turkey,
        Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the Prime Ministers of Azerbaijan
        and India, the authorized officials of Iran, Egypt, Palestine and Israel,
        the representatives of States and observer organizations. During the Summit
        the Heads of States and Governments of the Conference agreed to provide the
        CICA with the necessary structure and institutions to improve the efficiency
        of its functioning and instructed the Foreign Ministers to finalize all aspects
        of establishment of the CICA Secretariat to provide administrative support
        for regular meetings and political consultations and other activities within
        the framework of the forum.\n\nAccording to the results the Almaty Act was
        signed and the Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting Dialogue
        among Civilizations was adopted. The Second CICA Ministerial Meeting. On October
        22, 2004 __the Second Ministerial Meeting__, which resulted in the adoption
        of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures, Rules of Procedure and Declaration
        of the Second CICA Ministerial Meeting, was held. Admittance of the Kingdom
        of Thailand as the 17th CICA Member State on the eve of the event became another
        important event.\n\nAccording to the participants, the value of the adopted
        Catalogue of the Confidence Building Measures cannot be overestimated, since
        for the first time in the history of the Asian continent such a large-scale
        document that envisages multilateral cooperation between the countries on
        a wide range of issues of stability and security has appeared. The Declaration
        reflects the consolidated position of the vision and the CICA Member States
        on the key security issues in the world and the region. The heads of delegations
        stressed the need to develop a unified approach to solving the outstanding
        problems, directions of further cooperation in the context of confidence-building
        measures contained in the Catalogue.\n\n__The Second CICA Summit__\n\nOn June
        17, 2006 the Second Summit of the Forum was held. During the Summit a comprehensive
        policy document – the Declaration of the second Summit was adopted and the
        basic document on practical structuring of the meeting – the Statute of the
        CICA Secretariat was signed. The Declaration reflects the common vision of
        the Member States on the key issues of security and cooperation in Asia and
        the in world on the whole, the proposals of the Member States on development
        of a universal approach to addressing unresolved issues, and the need for
        practical implementation of the CICA Confidence Building Measures which included
        in the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures 2004, and the further development
        process was declared. On the same day, after signing of the relevant statutory
        document the CICA Secretariat was opened in Almaty. It is temporary located
        in the representative office of the MFA in Almaty.\nThe Third CICA Ministerial
        Meeting: The Third Ministerial Meeting held on August 25, 2008 in Almaty was
        attended by delegations of 19 Member States, 7 observer-countries s and 6
        international and regional organizations. A particular attention was paid
        to the practical implementation of the Cooperative approach. The meeting was
        productive enough: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates
        were granted the full member status, and the State of Qatar joined the CICA
        as an observer. The Declaration “The CICA Progress in implementation of Confidence
        Building Measures” and the final decision of the Ministerial Meeting were
        adopted.\n\nThe Protocol on amendments of the Statute of the CICA Secretariat,
        providing for the transfer of the CICA Secretariat headquarters from Almaty
        to Astana was signed. President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as the CICA
        Chairman, welcoming the start of executing confidence building measures in
        the human, economic and environmental dimensions as well as in combating new
        challenges and threats, spoke about the feasibility of implementation of practical
        work on development and strengthening cooperation in the military political
        dimension, which in the long run should become one of the most important areas
        of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures.\nThe Third CICA Summit.
        On June 8, 2010 in Istanbul the Third Summit of Heads of States and Governments
        of the CICA Member States was held. During the Summit for the first time in
        history of the Conference Chairmanship was transferred from the Republic of
        Kazakhstan to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n9 Heads of States and Governments,
        6 Vice-Presidents, Speakers of Parliament and Deputy Prime Ministers, 14 Ministers
        and Special Envoys participated in the Summit. 16 international organizations
        attended the meeting.\n\nThe Meeting coincided with the Chairmanship of Kazakhstan
        in the OSCE. Under the auspices of the OSCE on June 7, 2010 a special event:
        “Cooperation in the sphere of economy and security in the 21st century in
        Eurasia” was held. It was attended by the heads of the OSCE Foreign Ministries,
        the Asian partner countries of the OSCE and the CICA Member States. The event
        was very useful in terms of interaction between the OSCE and the CICA.\n\nMember
        States after long and intensive negotiations adopted the Declaration of the
        Summit, in which along with the regional issues (the Middle East, Afghanistan,
        Iraq), they managed to reflect the current issues of peace, security and stability,
        socio-economic development and culture. The condition on the need to resume
        negotiations on the establishment of the Palestinian state included in the
        document has become a significant achievement of the Summit. Signing of the
        Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the Secretariat, its personnel
        and representatives of the CICA, which had almost completed the institutionalization
        of the meeting, became a great success of the Summit.\n\nThus, __the 3rd CICA
        Summit__ made a significant contribution to further strengthening the international
        authority of Kazakhstan. On September 26, 2011 in New York on the initiative
        of the Turkish presidency on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly the
        first informal meeting of the CICA Foreign Ministers was held. An important
        aspect of the meeting was the signing of the CICA basic documents by the Kingdom
        of Bahrain and the Kingdom of Cambodia. In April 2012 Kazakhstan’s r proposal
        to extend the Chairmanship of Turkey for next two years tenure received the
        support of most CICA Member States. Therefore Turkey which assumed CICA Chairmanship
        in June 2010 will continue to hold the CICA Chairmanship for the period 2012-14. \n\nThe
        Commemorative session and __the Forth CICA Ministerial Meeting__: the CICA
        Commemorative session and Fourth Ministerial Meeting held on September 12,
        2012 in Astana was attended by delegations of 24 Member States, 8 observer
        countries and 16 international and regional organizations. The Commemorative
        session dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the idea of convening CICA was
        opened by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Ministerial
        Meeting was co-chaired by Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan and Turkey.\n\nDuring
        the meeting Foreign Ministers of the CICA Member States exchanged views on
        regional and global issues, and discussed ways of strengthening cooperation,
        peace and security in Asia as well as the prospects for further development
        of CICA.The granting the CICA observer status to TurkPA, and an announcement
        made by China about its readiness to be the next CICA Chairman became a significant
        event of the meeting. In October 2012 the candidacy of China for the next
        CICA Chairmanship for the period of 2014-2016 years was approved by the Member
        States through the silence procedure.\n\nFollowing the results of the CICA
        Commemorative session and the Fourth Ministerial Meeting a Declaration was
        adopted, in which issues of importance in the field of peace, security, stability
        and socio-economic development of the region, along with regional problems
        were reflected. The Declaration should give new impetus to the Conference
        in promoting peace and security in Asia.\n\nThe President of the Republic
        of Kazakhstan in his speech at the Commemorative session suggested transforming
        CICA into an organization.  On 25 September 2013 in New York on the grounds
        of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly was held an informal meeting
        of the CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs initiated by the Turkish Chairmanship.
        The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Ahmet Davutoğlu, Minister of
        Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, during which representatives of
        the CICA Member States exchanged their views on a range of issues on the international
        agenda, and ways of further development of the Conference.\n\n__The Fourth
        CICA Summit __\n\nThe Fourth Summit of CICA took place on 20-21 May 2014 in
        Shanghai (PRC) during which China assumed chairmanship over CICA from Turkey.
        47 states and international organizations attended the Meeting. For the first
        time, the UN Secretary General took part in the Summit, Qatar and Bangladesh
        joined the CICA as full members and a number of important documents, namely
        the Memorandum of Understanding between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
        and the Secretariat of CICA and the new Rules of Procedure which considerably
        concretized a legal framework of its activity, were signed and approved.\n\nFollowing
        the results of the Summit, the political Declaration «Enhancing Dialogue,
        Trust and Coordination for a New Asia of Peace, Stability and Cooperation»
        was adopted. The purposes and the tasks set in the Declaration, give a clear
        understanding that the Chinese chairmanship in CICA will be focusing on strengthening
        of political and social and economic security measures in Asia, ensuring trust
        and mutual respect through establishing its new architecture.  In his Speech
        at the Summit the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed an
        initiative for establishment on the basis of CICA - Organization for Security
        and Development in Asia (OSDA)."

              The idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the world, for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier attempts for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the idea of convocation of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian states defining the political climate on the continent, and the international organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings of the representatives of Foreign Ministries of Asian states were held. Following the results of the given meetings a Special Working Group (SWG) was established. The task of the Group includes preparation of documents for the meeting.

        Realization of tasks, the purposes and ideas of PFP Alliance is carried out within the main programs: Individual plan of action of partnership (IPAP), Process of planning and analysis (PAP), Individual program of partnership (IPP), Concept of operative potential (COP).

        The individual plan of action of partnership was accepted on January 31, 2006 for the purpose of harmonization of all aspects of interaction and their coordination with NATO.

        5 meetings with representatives of state authorities; 5 working meetings of experts of state authorities of Kazakhstan and NATO for an assessment of realization of IPAP; 1 meeting on the Clearing House mechanism (discussion of assistance to Kazakhstan from NATO countries on IPAP realization); 5 joint meetings of high level of North Atlantic Council and Kazakhstan in the NATO+Kazakhstan format took place within IPAP realization during the period from 2006 to 2012. On May 25 2011, Meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for discussion of an assessment of realization of the second cycle IPAP for 2009-2011 was held. The document was positively estimated by Alliance.

        The Ministry of Defense in coordination with the interested state authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan developed the third cycle IPAP for 2012-2013. The project is coordinated previously with the International staff of NATO. New actions in the field of policy, extreme civil planning, a science, and the military sphere are included in it.

        Interaction activization on the mechanism "Clearing House" which can affect high-quality realization of IPAP and plans of bilateral cooperation is initiated. Kazakhstan still shows interest in support of Alliance in definition of the leading country of Alliance (previously the USA expressed readiness to represent itself as the leading state).

        Kazakhstan participates in the "Planning and analysis process" (PAP) program since 2002. PAP is directed on basis creation for definition of structure and an assessment of forces and means, which can be presented for carrying out trainings, doctrines and operations at multinational level in interaction with forces of NATO, including peacekeeping operations. PAP has a biennial cycle. By means of selection and then realization of «The partnership purposes» are undertaken measures to increase the ability of divisions of AF of RK to cooperate with divisions of AF of the countries of NATO.

        The total number of the Purposes of Kazakhstan partnership according to a cycle PAP in 2010 makes 31 (of them 27 from MD, 3 BS from NSC RK, 1 from MES).

        The package of the Purposes of partnership includes the following questions:

        - Defensive planning and AF RK transformation;
        - Preparation and equipment of the peacekeeping contingent on NATO standards;
        - Language preparation;
        - Training of staff officers;
        - Questions of boundary safety;
        - Questions of response to crisis situations.

        In October 2011, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format on discussion of the text of the report of an assessment of realization accepted in 2010 took place. The Ministry of Defense led by the deputy Minister of Defense B. Maykeyev represented Kazakhstan at the meeting.

        During the period from May 23 to May 25 of this year in Astana consultations on discussion of the new Purposes of partnership within NATO program "Process of planning of the analysis" will take place, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for acceptance of the new Purposes of partnership will take place on June 21, 2012.

        In January, 2004 Kazakhstan joined the program «Concept of operative potential» (COP). The program itself presents the mechanism of an assessment of degree of readiness of peacekeeping divisions of the partner countries to interaction with armed forces of the countries of NATO. COP supplements the assessment which is carried out within PAP and promotes increase of military efficiency of estimated forces.

        Now fifteen already were trained on NATO courses on preparation of appraisers of COP on the first level and three officers of AF RK on the second level which allows to carry out self-image of the divisions (the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat") according to requirements of standards of NATO and they can participate on an assessment of divisions of the partner countries declared on the COP program on the basis of inquiry of Alliance.

        In 2006 and 2008 during carrying out the «Steppe Eagle» doctrine by experts of NATO the assessment of operative compatibility of the 2nd company of the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat" and the battalion with forces and means of NATO is carried out. The company is recognized operatively compatible, and a battalion partially operatively as the compatible.

        In 2009-2010 actions within the COP program weren't carried out. Participation of four Kazakhstan officers on a course on preparation of appraisers of the first level of the COP program is planned in May and June, 2012. Thus, in AF of RK number of prepared appraisers will be nineteen. According to COP program, term of certification of "Kazbat" procedures were expired in 2011 .In this regard, the Plan of implementation of the program NATO is approved and coordinated with NATO. For 2012-2013 within which for 2012 "Kazbat'" self-image by national experts, is planned for 2013 "Kazbat" assessment experts by NATO.

        Within preparation and carrying out self-image of "Kazbat" during the «Steppe eagle-2012» doctrine in the spirit of PFP in September of this year on the range "Iliysky" from February 7 to February 10, 2012 is led to the period advisory visit of experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with procedures of carrying out self-image within the COPEK program.

        Also in May visit of three experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with methods of carrying out self-image within the COP program of this year is planned.

        The individual program of partnership and cooperation (IPPC) serves as the annual plan of cooperation between Kazakhstan and NATO, in it the concrete actions which are subject to implementation on 37 (earlier - 33) areas of cooperation which include: assistance in strengthening of democratic control over armed forces, operative compatibility of forces and means, fight against terrorism and extreme civil planning.

        In 2011 147 actions took place within IPPC (507 military personnel serving AF RK, other armies and military formations). 180 actions are planned for 2012 within IPPC (by MD – 160, the MES – 11, MFA-5, the MIA – 2, PS NSC-2). This program also includes the actions which are carried out in the territory of Kazakhstan, such as seminars «Legal aspects of peacekeeping operations», «Process of planning of operations», courses «Military terminology of English in multinational operations», «Staff procedures of NATO» and «Acquaintance with culture and traditions of the people of Central Asia and Afghanistan» with participation of the military personnel of Kazakhstan and representatives of the countries of NATO and partners.

        In 2011 the Kazakhstan military personnel took part in the following doctrines:

        1. «The Viking - 2011» (on April 4-15 – Training center "Zetaleralbe", Austria).
        2. «Amber Hope - 2011» (on June 13-24 – Training center "Pabrada", Lithuania).
        3. «Combined Endevour - 2011» (on September 8-24 – Grafenvyor, Germany).
        4. «Regional cooperation - 2011» (on September 14-27 – Dushanbe, Tajikistan).
        5. «Challenge - 2011» (on October 3-7 – Training center «To Kazlu ruda», Lithuania).

        Courses on preparation for participation in missions of the United Nations from 2003 to 2012 over 30 military personnel of of RK had training preparation within IPPC.
        Participation of the military personnel of AF of RK in doctrines «Longbou's Cooperative», "Lancer Cooperative", "Combined Endevour", «Regional cooperation», "Amber Hope", «Search of the khan» is planned in 2012.

        It should be noted that realization of actions of IPPC in 2012 can be less effective, than in previous years in connection with new financial policy of NATO concerning some countries of partners (Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia).

        According to this policy of NATO will render 100 % the financial help to the partner countries having an internal gross product (gross domestic product) lower than10 000 US dollars per capita and to 80 % for the partner countries which have gross domestic product per capita between 10 000 and 13 550 US dollars. To the partner countries having gross domestic product of over 13 550 US dollars per capita, the financial help of NATO won't be rendered.

        Note: Gross domestic product of the Republic of Kazakhstan made 11 300 US dollars per capita in 2011. In the current year gross domestic product growth in 12 500 US dollars per capita is predicted. The Republic of Kazakhstan is included in the list of the partner countries, to which NATO can render to 80 % of financial support for participation in the planned actions within cooperation with Alliance.

        Due to the late informing by Alliance and the adoption of the budget of the Ministry of Defence of RK for 2012 the planned actions of IPPC-2012 will be realized within funds of MD of RK provided in the budget for 2012.

      title: Afghanistan
      body: "Kazakhstan has a pro-active actor in the world scene regards the situation
        in Afghanistan as a priority on its foreign policy agenda and exerts serious
        efforts to facilitate reconstruction in this country which plays a crucial
        role in the long-term security and stability in Central Asia. That’s why rehabilitation
        of this country is a major foreign policy priority of Kazakhstan who strongly
        favours a comprehensive and continued international effort to bring lasting
        peace and economic development to Afghanistan.\n\nOver the last years Kazakhstan
        made significant contribution to stabilization of Afghanistan. In 2001 Kazakhstan
        provided no-cost over-flight rights for “Enduring Freedom” operation. Similar
        arrangements have been developed and adopted between Kazakhstan and Germany
        at the end of 2007. In 2002 Kazakhstan offered its emergency landing air fields
        for US military and cargo planes. Being one of the key parts of so-called
        Northern Distribution Network through which about 35% of all US cargo arrives
        to Afghanistan since 2009 Kazakhstan made its rail and motor roads available
        for transit of non-lethal shipments needed for NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nKazakhstan
        has successfully allocate $50 million to educate 1000 Afghan people since
        2010. Education of Afghan people was carried out in the universities of Kazakhstan
        in such specialties as healthcare, agriculture, police, border control, engineering,
        teachers and educators. \n\nThis Cooperation in Education Agreement is successful
        and the foundation of a [new joint-program](https://astanatimes.com/2019/10/eu-undp-and-kazakhstan-launch-education-programme-to-train-afghan-women/)
        launched by Kazakhstan with the EU Commission and UNDP to graduate 50 Afghan
        women with advanced degrees from regional universities. \n\nIn 2018 Kazakhstana
        [hosted](https://astanatimes.com/2018/09/conference-on-empowerment-of-afghan-women-secures-e2-million-education-pledge-calls-for-enhanced-application-of-international-norms/)
        a Conference on empowerment of Afghan women and secured a €2 million education

        & Education of Afghan Women</h3>\n    <p class=\"usa-alert-text\">“Women empowerment
        is not only a matter of human rights and social justice. It’s about development,
        human growth and fulfilling the country’s potential. The European Union will
        continue to be the strongest supporter of women.”<br> \n    EU High Representative

        on Women’s Empowerment in Afghanistan<br>\nSeptember 7, 2018, Nur-Sultan \n
        \   </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nIn accordance with Bonn Process, 2006 London
        Conference, 2008 Paris Donor Conference on Afghanistan during 2006-2009 Kazakhstan
        has undertaken a number of steps like humanitarian aid to Afghanistan ($ 1
        mln.), scholarships for 100 Afghani students to study in the national universities
        (geology, engineering, etc.), training programs for Afghanistan’s police and
        internal security service, signing with Government of Afghanistan the Protocol
        of Intentions to build railway road Termez (Uzbekistan) – Kabul (Afghanistan)
        with further access to the transport infrastructure of India, creation of
        the Kazakh-Afghan Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n\nKazakhstan
        is the only Central Asian country which has the Assistance Program on Reconstruction
        of Afghanistan. In 2007-2008 Governmental Action Plan on Assistance to Afghanistan
        has been successfully accomplished. Total financial funding in sum of $ 3
        mln. has been provided to restore agricultural seed supply of Afghanistan
        ($0.5 mln.), to build a school in Samangan province ($0.28 mln.), a hospital
        in Bamiyan province ($0.57 mln.) and a road ($ 1.65 mln.).\n\nUnder the next
        Governmental Action Plan on Assistance to Afghanistan for 2009-2011 Kazakhstan
        allocated $5 million for projects related to water supply, infrastructure
        development and delivery of grains and other commodities.   \n\nThe Action
        Plan allocated considerable resources for providing humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.
        The aid included the delivery of commodities and materials as well as construction
        of four bridges crossing the river through the town of Aibak and strengthening
        the river banks.   \n\nKazakhstan also stands for more regional involvement
        to the solution of Afghan problem and, in this regard, fully supported the
        US strategy on Afghanistan which contained comprehensive vision on how to
        operate in «AfPak» zone. \n\nStabilization of Afghanistan was and continues
        to be one of the most important issues to discuss during high-level exchanges
        between Kazakhstan and USA."

    body: |-
      Kazakhstan takes seriously its international obligations in the fight against terrorism. As part of its commitments to implementing United Nations resolutions, Kazakhstan works closely with the  __Counter-Terrorism Committees of the UN Security Council__, and has joined the multilateral effort to combat transnational crime, such as illegal trafficking of drugs, arms, and human beings.

      President Nazarbayev has prioritized countering terrorism and violent extremism as one of the most serious threats to peace and security. President Nazarbayev has proposed several directions for UN member states to concentrate joint efforts.

      *"We need to establish a United Nations-led counter terrorism coalition and develop a common mechanism for locating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of extremism and terrorism. Secondly, we need to establish a United Nations-led counter terrorism coalition and develop a common mechanism for locating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of extremism and terrorism. Third, we must establish a universal set of regulations and rules related to the fight against terrorists and extremists, which would be applicable to all states."* - __President Nazarbayev__

      Kazakhstan has contributed US$300,000 to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund to support Member States in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In particular, the funds will be used to support the Implementation of the Joint Plan of Action for the United Nations Global Counter Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia. “We are convinced that the fight against this scourge must be waged by the joint efforts of all United Nations Member States and under United Nations principles”, he said. “Therefore, we consider our present contribution to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre as one of the important elements to prevent and address these challenges in Central Asia,” said Yerzhan Ashikbayev, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan.

      __Tourism in Kazakhstan - The Land of Wonders__

      Kazakhstan is a unique region in the world, because of its history, geographical position and size. Being the world’s 9th largest country and located in the centre of Eurasia, it is also the largest landlocked country in the world. These resulted in a specific climate and a peculiar natural system of the country, which seems to absorb the brightest examples of landscape of both continents. In addition, complicated history of Kazakh people and constant interaction of nomadic lifestyle with settled people in South Kazakhstani ancient cities, have lead to a unique and authentic culture of Kazakhstan.

      These peculiarities have created an opportunity to develop various and diverse offers for travel and tourism in Kazakhstan, which include authentic cultural tourism,nature-based activities, including ecotourism, birdwatching, etc. in national parks and protected areas, skiing or trekking in mountains, water sports, sunbathing andswimming in lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan, and many others. 

      __Nature-based tourism__

      Diversity of natural areas has contributed to rich flora and fauna of Kazakhstan. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 species of birds and 107 species of fish; and over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves were established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.

      The most famous of them among tourists include Aksu Zhabagly Nature Reserve, which is a habitat of snow leopard and other rare animals, and is also known as a Kingdom of Tulips, where tulips are believed to originate, long before they were introduced in Holland; Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve is famous for its pink flamingos and other rare species of wildlife, and popular among bird-watchers; Altyn Emel National Park is interesting for its mystery of Singing Dune; Katon-Karagay National Park is a habitat of marals (red deers), unossified antlers of which are used as a precious medicine. 

      __Mountains: Trekking and winter sports__

      A range of high, middle and low mountains, such as Tien Shan, Altay, Ulytau, Kazygurt, etc. have a beautiful nature attracting tourists from all over the world. Tien Shan Mountains is the highest among them (with the highest peak of about 7000 metres), and Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, is located at its bottom. Thus, an easy access to marvelous landscapes for tourists interested in trekking and winter sports is available from Almaty city.

      Most popular climbing routes are located in the Small Almaty Valley and Bogdanovich Glacier. Attractions of these places include Pogrebetsky Glacier (4,231 meters), Tuyuc Su (4100 m), Ordzhonikidze (3980 m) peaks, and many others. In addition, high mountains of Kazakhstan are ideal for winter sports. There is no wonder that Kazakhstan hosted Winter Asian Games in 2011: one of the priorities of the country has been propaganda of winter sports.

      A unique sport complex Medeu (sometimes spelled as Medew or Medeo), with a skating rink popular among tourists, was built in 1950’s, at 1691 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest skating rink in the world. A sophisticated artificial refrigeration system enables to keep high quality ice coverage over 8-months of the year. Another major winter sport attraction of Kazakhstan is Shymbulak (Chimbulak) ski resort, also located not far from Almaty. Snow lies in these places from November till May; however, sunny weather is usually registered there during more than three hundred days each year. The resort hotel can accept up to 114 tourists. 

      __Lakes and rivers: water sports, sunbathing and health resorts__

      Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.
      Coast of the biggest lake in the world – Caspian Sea is perfect for sunbathing, swimming and fishing. The largest number of reservoirs is concentrated in the south-east part of the country, in the region with a symbolic name Zhetysu - “Seven Rivers”. Almost all the rivers of Zhetysu belong to the basin of Lake Balkhash, which is also a popular tourist destination for its health centres and recreation camps. Besides health resorts, rafting in mountain rivers for extreme tourists, boating and sailing in lakes are only a few examples of activities offered for tourists in Kazakhstan.

      __Culture: ethnotourism__

      Unique culture of Kazakhstan is a reason to travel to Kazakhstan for many tourists. Almost in every corner of the republic, a visitor, interested in real life of Kazakh people - their traditions, rituals, art and culture, will find many things of interest. These include museum complexes, ethno villages, depicting traditional lifestyle of Kazakh people, historical sites of medieval cities and many others.

      For example, tourists are offered to experience traditional lifestyle of Kazakhs, to try national dishes and to interact with the local people in Shabanbay Bi Village, situated in Kyzylaray Mountains, Central Kazakhstan. Zhambyl Zhabayev museum complex in Almaty region includes a house with a garden, where the poet lived in XIX-XX centuries and a mausoleum. This is a visual representation of not only Zhambyl’s life, but also of a whole era in which the poet lived and worked. South Kazakhstan is famous for ancient cities located at the routes of the Great Silk Road with historical monuments and other sites.

      Ethno-memorial complex Map of Kazakhstan - Atameken, located in Astana, is the largest ethnographic park in Kazakhstan and a unique outdoor museum. Cities and landscapes of the country, as well as mini copies of main attractions and historical sites can be found on the map.

        and in the grass steppe subzone. The area of the city stands above the flood
        plain. The Yessil River is a major waterway of the capital. The city has an
        extreme continental climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan
        hosted the 2017 world's fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana Expo
        2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s favourable location in the centre
        of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically advantageous transport,
        communication and logistics centre, and a natural bridge between Europe and
        Asia.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yrqt_3Po2LE\"

        to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
        high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
        in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for
        10 percent, while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2 percent.\n\nThe
        city has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan. \n\nEntrepreneurship
        is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are more than 128,000 small
        and medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan is among the leading cities
        of the country in terms of the volume of construction. After the city became
        the capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres of housing facilities
        have been built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan and abroad took part
        in the construction of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural concept of Nur-Sultan
        was based on the idea of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying a special Eurasian
        style of Nur-Sultan should harmoniously combine the cultural traditions of
        both the East and the West. A well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa
        became the author of the general layout of the capital city.\n\nToday Nur-Sultan,
        located in the heart of Eurasia, is a venue for numerous international forums,
        congresses and large scale international events. The Congress of Leaders of
        World and Traditional Religions, the Astana Economic Forum and other forums
        are held regularly in the city. In December, 2010, the historical Summit of
        the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe took place in the
        capital city of Kazakhstan, after which it hosted the anniversary summits
        of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
        In early 2011, the city welcomed the participants and guests of the 7th Asian
        Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted the international specialized exhibition
        EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military district was founded in 1832 on
        the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods. Until 1961, the name
        of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and because of its ideal location,
        it soon turned into a central point for trade livestock fairs. In 1961, the
        name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola in 1992. Astana was not the
        official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital was renamed to Nur-Sultan after
        the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n### Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n-
        In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s area was over 300 sq. km., but today, the city boundaries
        are rapidly expanding.\n- The distance between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the
        former capital, is 1,318 km.\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s population was about
        300,000. This year (2009), the population has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn
        1997, the President of Kazakhstan made the decision to relocate the capital
        of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Akmola city (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n-
        Advantageous geopolitical location\n- Considerable industrial potential\n-
        Crucial resources for subsequent development of the construction industry\n-
        Location in the largest transport junction\n- Essential transport and telecommunication
        infrastructure\n- Highly skilled urban workforce\n- Large private sector\n-
        Potentialities for entrepreneurship development\n- Political and social stability\n-
        Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe most important reason for
        moving the capital and expanding and improving the city of Nur-Sultan was
        to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically stable and prosperous, democratically
        viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt Nur-Sultan’s historical
        inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From now on any major decisions
        important for the future of the people will be made here in the centre of
        this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland is beating here. Kazakhstan
        is making and defining its history and destiny here and today.”\n\nIn 1998,
        the decision was made to officially change the name of the new capital Akmola
        to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year later, the Astana from waterUnited
        Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) granted
        the status, “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe city’s rapid growth as the
        administrative and business center of the country matches the original concept
        for social and economic development. The theme of this concept is “The blossoming
        of Astana is the blossoming of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More than 200 joint ventures
        and foreign companies are operating in the capital, including those belonging
        to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Kyrgyzstan\n- Switzerland.\n \nAstana
        is a member of the International Association of Capitals and Cultural Cities
        of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); it also has close bilateral
        relations with 13 cities and regions of the CIS.\n\n__The growth of Astana,
        as a result of it becoming the new capital, has had a powerful influence on
        neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n- Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n- East
        Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also supported the development of entrepreneurship
        and businesses which will, in turn, lead to the opening of foreign companies,
        firms, and major bank branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business Magnet__\n\nAstana
        is a major center of activity and the hub of national and international transport

        South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The
        Volga region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government
        have spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and 2004,
        the number of new legal entities registered in the capital more than doubled,
        and the local housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers of the

        only famous in Kazakhstan but within the scientific world. In addition to
        the three museums, Astana also has branches of the Union of Writers and Artists

        in the tradition of international cinemas and has become a favorite of the
        people of Astana.\n\n__Eighth Wonder of the World__\n\nIn September 2006,
        the inauguration of the Palace of Peace and Accord (62 meters in height),
        also known as the Peace Pyramid, marked another milestone in Astana’s evolution
        and may well become the Eighth Wonder of the World. Built to house the Assembly
        of Nations of Kazakhstan, a university, a museum, a library and a winter garden,
        the pyramid was designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster, who is famous
        for his futuristic glass roof on the German Parliament, the Reichstag.\n\n__Special

        According to the General Development Plan of the Capital, the integrated structure
        of this complex, located on the left bank, will symbolize the new capital.\n\n__The

            value: The Akmolinsk outer military district was founded in 1832 on the
              banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods. Until 1961, the name
              of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and because of its ideal
              location, it soon turned into a central point for trade livestock fairs. In
              1961, the name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola in 1992. Astana
              was not the official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital was renamed
              to Nur-Sultan after the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.

            value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its
              territory is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape
              is far from uniform, as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains,
              and river valleys. In the North is found the Kokshetau summit; in the
              southern and south-eastern portions of the region is the Saryarka, part
              of the Kazakh topography; and plains compose the North-East.

        To promote tourism, Kazakhstan enforced a “Law on Tourism” (1992) that embraces virtually all types of tourism. __The law also addresses key issues of tourism activities:__

        - Legal
        - Economic
        - Social
        - Organizational

        In addition to this law, the Government has adopted several enactments concerning tourism concerns, including a number of documents that regulate the licensing of tourism activities. In 1993, the National Program for developing Kazakhstan’s tourism industry was adopted, and in 1997, the Government passed the State Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, designed to accomplish the following goals:

        - Regenerate historic centers of the Great Silk Route
        - Preserve and development the cultural legacy of Turkic-speaking states
        - Create the tourism infrastructure from 1997-2003.

        Additionally, Kazakhstan became a member of the World Tourism Organization in 1993.
        The Committee for Regulation of Trade and Tourist Activity, a branch of the Ministry for Industry and Trade, is the body that manages tourism in Kazakhstan. Certain executive departments and tourism representatives from other countries carry out the administration of this committee.

        In 1997, Kazakhstan created the Strategy of tourism development, intended to be intact through 2030. Today, 430 tourism agencies, firms, and bureaus of various property forms function effectively in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They employ nearly 6,000 people and 1,500 professional guides. Kazakhstan tourism firms cooperate with almost 80 countries of the world; approximately 25 tourism firms in Almaty and five in regional centers arrange charter flights to the following countries:

        - India
        - Turkey
        - The United Arab Emirates
        - Pakistan
        - South Korea
        - Greece
        - Poland.

        There are also cooperative agreements with the following places:

        - Turkey
        - Iran,
        - The Xinjang Uigur Autonomous Area of China
        - Moldova
        - Hungary
        - The State of Israel
        - Kyrghyzstan
        - Egypt

        In addition to those already in place, Kazakhstan is in the process of making intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements with other nations, including:

        - Croatia
        - Pakistan
        - Singapore

        Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in United Kingdom tourists over the past few years, and with the recent visa simplification procedures (letters of invitation are no longer required of EU and US citizens) still greater numbers are expected.

    title: Horse Culture
    body: "Strong evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5919/1332\">Botai
      civilization</a> was the first to domesticate the horse. Research and analysis
      of escavated pottery and other artifacts has coalesced the opinion that the
      ancient inhabitants of what is modern-day Kazakhstan used horses to aid them
      with their day-to-day lives.  \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/horse-culture/\"

      Significance of the Horse in Kazakh Culture\n\nWhile the people of the Great
      Steppe had tamed horses thousands of years ago, the horse, its symbolism and
      history are woven into the fabric of Kazakh culture and modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\nThe
      world cultural community recognizes the unique and special role equines have
      in Kazakh culture. UNESCO has included the __traditional Spring Festive Rites
      of Kazakh horse breeders__ on the Representative List of the [Intangible Cultural
      Heritage (ICH) of Humanity](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-spring-festive-rites-of-the-kazakh-horse-breeders-01402).
      \n\nPreceded by year-long preparations, the the Spring Festive Rites of Kazakh
      Horse Breeders include: \n\n- __Biye baylau__ (tethering mares), the ancient
      first milking rite encompassing the separation of mares and foals from the herds,
      milking the mares and celebrating with songs, dances and games. \n- __Ayghyr
      kosu__ (the stallion’s marriage), a rite for adjoining stallions in herds to
      commence a new breeding season. \n- __Kymyz muryndyk__ the opening of the Spring
      season's Kymyz sharing rite and marks the season's production and sharing among
      other families. Kymyz, pronounced \"koumiss\", is a fermented mare's milk beverage.

      Sayis - National Horse Racing Games\n- __Kokpar__\nThis game consists of two
      teams of horse riders. The objective is for the team to gather a goat carcass
      and bring it to their part of the playing field, past a designated line. Each
      time tries to do this as many times as possible to gain points.\n- __Audaryspak__\n
      \ The objective of this game is quite simple: two horsemen must wrestle and
      attempt to push each other off of his saddle. \n- __Kyz kuu__ \n  In this game,
      a horseman tries to catch a girl on a horse galloping at full speed. He has
      to do this before she reaches the finish line. If he catches her, he may kiss
      her. But, if he loses, the girl must catch him and whip him (playfully, of course).\n-
      __Kumys-alu__\n  This game is quite easy to grasp, too. A horseman must gallop
      on his horse and attempt to pick up coins scattered on the ground. The rider
      gets to keep the coins he gathers as a prize.\n- __Tenge alu__ \n- __Zhaby atu__
      \n- __Zhorga zharys__"

    title: Alphabet
    body: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree October 26, 2017 to
      modernize the existing Kazakh alphabet to Latin-based script, and amended his
      decree in February 2018 to better modernize some characters. President Nazarbayev
      announced his intention to switch from the Cyrillic-based alphabet to Latin
      script in April 2012. The new alphabet consists of 32 letters and letters of
      the old Cyrillic alphabet will be replaced by Latin analogues based on their
      phonetic similarity. Kazakhs used Arabic script from the 10th-20th centuries.
      The Kazakh language was based on Latin script in 1929-1940. The transition to
      the Cyrillic alphabet occurred in 1940. The Latin alphabet is currently used
      by most Kazakh diasporas abroad.

            Learning and Teaching Initiative (PILTI), which upgraded the technological
            capacity of thousands of secondary schools. Launched in 2007 by former
            Minister of Education and Science Zhanseit Tuimebayev, the PILTI aims
            to enhance the teaching of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
            by providing schools with a 21st century learning environment. To do that,
            education officials have assembled a team of the world’s top suppliers
            of innovative education products, including members of the UK consortium
            TVET UK and the California-based firm Pasco Scientific. In the less than
            five years since its launch, PILTI has facilitated the installation of
            new STEM and language teaching technologies in more than 20,000 classrooms
            across the country. More than 40,000 Kazakh teachers have been trained
            to use these new tools and incorporate them into a pedagogical method
            that emphasizes student participation, rather than lecturing.

      title: Bolashak Scholarship
      body: |-
        In 1993, Kazakhstan was the first Central Asian country to launch a presidential scholarship program, ‘Bolashak’, for international study. ‘Bolashak’, which means ‘future’ in Kazakh, speaks to the importance Kazakhstan puts on educating its youth at the best universities in the world. The Bolashak Programme is an all-expenses paid scholarship sponsored by awarded to high-performing students from Kazakhstan for graduate study at an overseas university. Upon completion of their graduate degree, Bolashak scholars are required to return to work in Kazakhstan for at least five years. The program is designed to train future leaders in business, international relations, law, science, engineering and other key fields.

        Since its implementation in 1993, more than 6,500 students have been awarded the scholarship, with most choosing to study in the United States and Great Britain.They have successfully graduated from America’s leading universities including Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Emory, Carnegie Mellon, Indiana University, Vanderbilt and many others.

The local ethnos – Kazakhs make the largest part of the population – 58.9%, while Russian – 25.9%, Ukrainians – 2.9%, Uzbeks – 2,8%, Uighur, Tatar and German - 1.5% each, and other groups 4,3%. There are more than 100 ethnic groups living in peace in Kazakhstan.

      Many nationalities have come to Kazakhstan not on their own will, but were driven here by political repression and persecution. In Stalin’s times Kazakhstan hosted 1.5 million of political prisoners from Russia and other regions of the USSR. And more than 1.3 million of people were deported by Stalin regime during World War II years “as representatives of unreliable nations”. All these people found understanding and support of Kazakh people, found their second Motherland on the land of Kazakhstan.

      The principle of equality of all ethnic groups that inhabit our country is strictly adhered by. All conditions for a full national self-expression have been created as well as the rights for the fulfilment of their ethno cultural interests are ensured. Legal guarantees and respectful treatment of all the languages used in the republic defend the integral right of citizens of any nationality to develop their language and culture. Figures witness the balance and harmony of the national policy: about 40% of secondary schools use Russian language in teaching. The higher education for 70% is available in Russian language. In areas of residence of compact ethnic groups schools function with Uyghur, Tajik, Ukrainian, German, Polish and other languages of teaching.

      The Sunday schools of national and cultural unions also receive support in the teaching of native languages. Today 30 languages of ethnic groups of Kazakhstan are taught in about 200 Sunday schools and 3 schools of national revival. Magazines and newspapers are published, TV and radio programs are broadcast in 11 national language in Kazakhstan. Books in the languages of ethnic minorities of Kazakhstan are published annually on the state order with a total number exceeding 80 000. Besides Kazakh and Russian theatres there are also Uyghur, German and Korean ones.

      Ethnic cultural centres have been established in all areas of Kazakhstan, to support ethnic identity of different nationalities. Their highest forum is the Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. Today this powerful social force has become an organic part of the civil society and expresses its views in the chambers of the Parliament, political parties, mass-media, state and non-government organizations. The Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan has become an important element of the political system of Kazakhstan. It has forged the interests of all the ethnos and ensures the rights and freedoms of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion. 27 republican and regional, more than 300 district ethnic cultural unions enter the Assembly of people of Kazakhstan. Three centres have an international status. The Assembly deals with 16 Small Regional Assemblies of peoples of Kazakhstan which act as consultative bodies by the regional administrations and comprise representatives of local ethnic-cultural and social unions.

      Kazakhstan’s efforts to ensure inter-ethnic peace and accord are essential for internal stability and are widely recognized in the world. The Pope as well as UN General Secretary Koffi Annan who paid visits to our country over the last five years cited Kazakhstan as the example of inter-ethnic consent and sustainable development of a multi-ethnic society. The interethnic policy is based on the principle of unity in variety. The civil peace and consent in Kazakhstan are the result of a persistent policy of the Government which enjoys the support of the whole society.

    title: Literature
    body: "Abay Kunanbaev (1845-1904). Abay was born in 1845 at the bottom of the
      Chingiz Mountain in the today's Abai district (former Karkaraly) located in
      Eastern Kazakhstan region (formerly, the Semipalatinsk region).\n\nHe was a
      well-known Kazakh poet, a great thinker, composer, philosopher, the founder
      of written Kazakh literature, and its first classic.\n\nThe heritage he left
      his nation is rich in songs and poems, translations and prose. His translations
      of the poetry written by Russian writers and poets such as Pushkin, Lermontov,
      and Krylov became the national patrimony of Kazakhstan. He translated the works
      of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron into Kazakh language.\n\nAbai Kunanbaev is the
      Shakesphere of Kazakh literature.  His [Book of Words](http://kazakhworld.com/abai-kunanbaev-book-of-words/),
      «Kara Sozder», created by the great thinker constitute an ethnic philosophical
      work. This creation of his is an exploration of Kazakh national life in the
      second half of the 19th century. He influenced social affairs in the country
      where he lived.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/abai-slides/\"
      width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nHe also participated
      in the governing of the country and played a certain role in trying to solve
      complicated problems justly.\n\nThe name of Abai is known worldwide just as
      Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin are well-known in many countries, because his
      great words became a spiritual patrimony of not only one nation, but of the
      entire humankind.\n\nAbay's main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore
      lies in his poetry, which expresses great nationalism and grew out of Kazakh
      folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing the nomadic habits
      of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abay's lifetime, however, a number
      of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred. Russian influence
      continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational possibilities
      as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether Russian,
      Western or Asian. Abay Qunanbayuli steeped himself in the cultural and philosophical
      history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense, Abay's creative poetry
      affected the philosophical thinking of educated Kazakhs.\n\nThe leaders of the
      Alash Orda movement saw him as their inspiration and spiritual predecessor.\n\nContemporary
      Kazakh images of Abay generally depict him in full traditional dress holding
      a dombra (the Kazakh national instrument). Today, Kazakhs revere Abay as one
      of the first folk heroes to enter into the national consciousness of his people.
      Almaty State University is named after Abay, so is one of the main avenues in
      the city of Almaty. There are also public schools with his name.\n\nContent

    title: Horse Culture
    body: "Strong evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5919/1332\">Botai
      civilization</a> was the first to domesticate the horse. Research and analysis
      of escavated pottery and other artifacts has coalesced the opinion that the
      ancient inhabitants of what is modern-day Kazakhstan used horses to aid them
      with their day-to-day lives.  \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/horse-culture/\"
      width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n##
      Significance of the Horse in Kazakh Culture\n\nWhile the people of the Great
      Steppe had tamed horses thousands of years ago, the horse, its symbolism and
      history are woven into the fabric of Kazakh culture and modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\nThe
      world cultural community recognizes the unique and special role equines have
      in Kazakh culture. UNESCO has included the __traditional Spring Festive Rites
      of Kazakh horse breeders__ on the Representative List of the [Intangible Cultural
      Heritage (ICH) of Humanity](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-spring-festive-rites-of-the-kazakh-horse-breeders-01402).
      \n\nPreceded by year-long preparations, the the Spring Festive Rites of Kazakh
      Horse Breeders include: \n\n- __Biye baylau__ (tethering mares), the ancient
      first milking rite encompassing the separation of mares and foals from the herds,
      milking the mares and celebrating with songs, dances and games. \n- __Ayghyr
      kosu__ (the stallion’s marriage), a rite for adjoining stallions in herds to
      commence a new breeding season. \n- __Kymyz muryndyk__ the opening of the Spring
      season's Kymyz sharing rite and marks the season's production and sharing among
      other families. Kymyz, pronounced \"koumiss\", is a fermented mare's milk beverage.

      Sayis - National Horse Racing Games\n- __Kokpar__\nThis game consists of two
      teams of horse riders. The objective is for the team to gather a goat carcass
      and bring it to their part of the playing field, past a designated line. Each
      time tries to do this as many times as possible to gain points.\n- __Audaryspak__\n
      \ The objective of this game is quite simple: two horsemen must wrestle and
      attempt to push each other off of his saddle. \n- __Kyz kuu__ \n  In this game,
      a horseman tries to catch a girl on a horse galloping at full speed. He has
      to do this before she reaches the finish line. If he catches her, he may kiss
      her. But, if he loses, the girl must catch him and whip him (playfully, of course).\n-
      __Kumys-alu__\n  This game is quite easy to grasp, too. A horseman must gallop
      on his horse and attempt to pick up coins scattered on the ground. The rider
      gets to keep the coins he gathers as a prize.\n- __Tenge alu__ \n- __Zhaby atu__
      \n- __Zhorga zharys__"

      body: "Fighting corruption is one of the priorities of President Tokayev and
        is fundamental to Kazakhstan’s 100 Concrete Steps programme, the massive reform
        project intended to accelerate the country’s development, and realization
        of Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy goals. Kazakhstan has developed an effective legal
        and institutional platform to facilitate the anti-corruption policies. The Civil
        Service Affairs and Anti-Corruption Agency works on detecting and stopping
        corruption offenses in all spheres. \n\nPresident Tokayev [signed a law](https://astanatimes.com/2019/12/tokayev-signs-law-making-ministers-and-governors-responsible-for-corruption-among-subordinates/)
        in December 2019 making ministers and akims (governors) responsible for corruption
        among their direct subordinates Nov. 28. The law introduces amendments that
        will oblige ministers and governors to resign if the top officials in their
        institutions are found guilty of corruption.\n\nKazakhstan's National Bureau
        of Anti-Corruption has established close cooperation with the United States,
        the United Nations (UNO), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
        Europe (OSCE), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
        Transparency International and others. Kazakhstan has pledged to provide information
        on anticorruption measures, involve NGOs in anticorruption policies and continue
        to develop an anti-corruption culture. The Modern Anti-Corruption Standards

      title: Astana International Finance Centre
      body: |-
        Kazakhstan enters a new phase of the development after a period of high economic growth. The crisis of 2007-2009 was successfully overcome through the use of accumulated resources. Sovereign wealth funds, established in the previous years, played a major role in the economic development. With the falling prices for the country's main export commodities, new approaches to public policy are necessary. In particular, diversification of economy, better management of the accumulated funds and assets, as well as the development of a financial services market have become important. At the same time, the country's integration into regional cooperation organisations and the Eurasian Economic Union creates conditions for accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan into the global financial system. 

        Five institutional reforms of the Head of State and Hundred Concrete Steps Program to implement these reforms (hereinafter – Plan of the Nation) have become a new starting point in the development of Kazakhstan. As part of the Plan of the Nation, [Astana International Financial Centre](http://www.aifc.kz/) (hereinafter – AIFC) was established at the order of the President of Republic of Kazakhstan with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition (hereinafter – EXPO-2017) infrastructure. 

        A Constitutional Law providing favourable environment for the AIFC participants was passed for a successful launch of the AIFC. The main goal of AIFC, like of any other state reform, is to improve welfare of Kazakhstan residents. Various aspects of the AIFC shall allow improving the approaches to managing sovereign wealth funds and facilitating the transfer of foreign knowledge and technology to the country, thus, ensuring an increase and the development of human capital. The slowdown of business cycles in the country due to the deteriorating conditions in foreign markets and unfavourable geopolitical situation in the region, only justifies the need for a financial centre - it is important now more than ever to attract new investments in the financial capital, as well as in technology and human capital. The initiative to establish an international financial centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development. 

        In order to establish AIFC as a local centre of expertise with a developed capital market and later to develop it into a regional platform for financial intermediation, the strategy for the development of AIFC has been developed until 2021, inclusive. Implementing the initial phase of the development of the AIFC shall serve as a solid foundation for the realisation of the subsequent phases, namely, development into a regional financial centre, and eventually, into an international financial centre. The strategy for the development of AIFC shall be reviewed upon the implementation of each phase of the development due to a change of goals and objectives.

      title: Doing Business
      body: |-
        The Government of Kazakhstan has made significant efforts to remove bureaucratic obstacles to investment and the creation of an attractive business environment, which has been consistently reflected in the last four editions of the World Bank’s Doing Business report as well as other internationally recognized indices.  

        <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/global-rankings/" width="100%" height="700px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

        The Constitution affords foreign investors the same rights and obligations as Kazakh nationals. The Investment Code guarantees foreign firms equality between local and foreign investors, protection of investor’s rights, arbitration of disputes, guarantees against nationalization and affirms the right to repatriate profits. Thanks to these, the country ranks 22nd in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank. Foreign firms invest in almost all sectors of the economy.

        The country has a comprehensive system promoting inflow of FDI into domestic-oriented production and export-oriented local production. The government provides investment preferences such as exemptions from customs duties, state grants in kind, privileges relating to land tax and property tax for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects, and industrial privileges for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects in residential areas with a low level of social economic development.

        In 2019, FDI amounted to almost $25 billion, the equivalent of 10% of GDP, and has brought new technology and jobs for domestic suppliers and subcontractors and has generated new types of employment and training for Kazakhs. The majority of FDI has targeted the oil, gas and mining sectors and associated services, so the government puts a large emphasis on encouraging investment in industries other than oil & gas and mining as part of its 2050 Strategy. To eliminate the dependence on resource extraction industries, the government adopted plans to focus on diversification of economy to become knowledge-based modern economy.

        The government's efforts to strengthen the state's fiscal balance, reduce national debt, and aid the recovery of the banking sector following the 2007-08 crisis prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade Kazakhstan's sovereign rating to BBB + with a stable outlook in November 2012. Kazakhstan’s progressive, pro-business laws also support the growth of foreign investment and stronger economic growth. Doing business in Kazakhstan becomes easier and more inviting for foreign investors each year.

        ### Invest in Kazakhstan
        Kazakhstan's Investment Code guarantees foreign firms equality between local and foreign investors, protection of investor’s rights, arbitration of disputes, guarantees against nationalization and the right to repatriate profits.

        __Kazakhstan ranks 22nd in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank.__

        Kazakhstan has institutions to promote and support investment, including KazNexInvest and the Foreign Investors’ Council, and now plans to establish a new role of an investment ombudsman to help facilitate communication between investors and the government and help investors address their issues. In recent years, the government has also used joint ventures as an effective instrument to bring in foreign expertize and capital it needs to co-fund industries such as construction, logistics, petrochemicals, manufacturing and IT.

        <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/investment-incentives-benefits/" width="100%" height="500px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

        __Incentives for Priority Projects__

        Kazakhstan has established a highly preferential regime for those investment projects classified as “priority investment projects”. The primary criterion for a Project is investment of not less than approx. USD 20 million in one of the areas specified by the Government.

        Those who invest in Kazakhstan and conclude an investment contract for a Project with the authorized body (currently the Investments Committee under the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies), may enjoy the following advantages (as specifically set out in an investment contract):

        __1) exemption from corporate income tax (20%) for up to 10 years;__

        __2) exemption from land tax for up to 10 years;__

        __3) exemption from property tax for up to 8 years from the date when fixed assets (e.g., a plant) are commissioned (only for those assets which were commissioned for the first time);__

        __4) reimbursement of up to 30 percent of actual expenses on construction works and purchase of equipment (so-called “investment subsidy” (*4)) on the basis of documentary evidence after full commissioning. To apply for an investment subsidy, an applicant must also provide a feasibility study approved by the state expertise. The Government will approve the rules on granting investment subsidies;__

        __5) exemption from the need to obtain work permits for foreign workers of the legal entity holding the investment contract, its contractors and subcontractors in the area of research and design activities, engineering services and construction works. Such exemption is valid until the expiration of 1 year from the date of commissioning. The list of professions and number of attracted staff is set out in the investment contract;__

        __6) stability with regard to the above tax preferences and “work permits-free” regime;__

        __7) interaction with the Investments Committee under the principle of “one window”. An investor shall only file an application to the Investments Committee with related documents and negotiate further with the Committee regarding conditions of the investment contract;__

        __8) simplified procedure for obtaining land plots for a Project;__

        __9) assistance from the Investments Committee with regard to obtaining a guaranteed order(s) from national state-owned companies;__

        __10) (this preference existed earlier and remains valid) exemption from customs fees for the import of technological equipment and spare parts, for the period of an investment contract, but not more than 5 years.__

      title: Investment Policy
      body: "Due to political and economic stability in Kazakhstan, the abundance
        of natural resources, as well as high annual economic growth over the past
        several years, foreign investors continue invest in Kazakhstan and view it
        as a favorable place to do business.\nOne of the most important issues to
        foreign investors is the repatriation of their profits and the tax implications
        of their income. Civil legislation allows foreign investors to operate in
        Kazakhstan through either a local branch of a foreign company or a local subsidiary
        established as an independent legal entity under the laws of Kazakhstan. Naturally,
        a foreign investor should determine which type of investment structure is
        preferable.\n\n### Foreign Investors’ Council\nThe [Foreign Investors’ Council
        (FIC)](https://fic.kz/eng/) is an advisory body established by the Order of
        the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan to promote direct dialogue between
        the government and those who invest in Kazakhstan in order to efficiently
        address key issues related to their investment activities in the country,
        to improve the investment climate of Kazakhstan for the benefit of foreign
        investors, local and national companies, the economic development and wealth
        of the country and its people.\n\nThe FIC is chaired by the President of the
        Republic of Kazakhstan, who supervises its activities, including approval
        of the Agenda and chairmanship at the Council's plenary sessions.\n\n### The
        major objectives of the FIC \nDeveloping and submitting recommendations to
        the President and Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on key investment
        and economic development issues. Analyzing and discussing other core investment
        policy issues upon the instruction of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan
        is represented in the Council by the following government officials: Prime
        Minister, Chairman of the National Bank, Deputy Head of the President’s Administration,
        Deputy Prime-Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Industry and
        New Technologies, Minister of Finance, Minister of Economic Development and
        Trade, and Head of the Executive Body of the Council (Chairman of the Committee
        on Investments of the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies). \n\nThe
        foreign side of the Council is represented by top managers of international
        organizations, economic and financial institutions, foreign companies and
        corporations. The Plenary Sessions of the Council are conducted once or twice
        a year. For more information about current members of the FIC, please visit www.fic.kz.\nInvestment
        Ombudsman\n\nKazakhstan is putting in its best efforts to ensure the continuing
        improvement of its business and investment climate. The establishment of a
        task force on the protection of rights of foreign investors, the so-called
        “investment ombudsman”, is the most recent example of those efforts. \n\nThe
        institution of Investment Ombudsman was established in the Law on Investment
        adopted in 2014. In December 2015, Minister of Investment and Development
        Asset Issekeshev was appointed as the the Investment Ombudsman of Kazakhstan.
        Issekeshev began his duties January 1, 2016. \n\nThe institution is based
        on international best practices, in particular on the successful experience
        of South Korea where this institution had been functioning since 1999 and
        helped resolve all 4,500 complaints between 2000 and 2012 without any one
        of them reaching the courts.\n\nAnyone who invests in Kazakhstan, or an embassy
        on their behalf, will be able to appeal to the investment ombudsman on specific
        issues and problems and file requests both through the Secretariat, located
        at the Investment Committee of the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies,
        and the Investors’ Support Center at the National Agency for Export and Investments
        KAZNEX INVEST, which is a part of the structure of the Ministry of Industry
        and New Technologies of Kazakhstan."

    title: Democracy
    body: "Kazakhstan is a constitutional republic and is a fledging democracy after
      a long period of being a republic of the former Soviet Union.  According to
      Kazakhstan’s constitution, Kazakhstan's democracy is secular and values individual
      “life, rights, and freedoms.” Kazakhstan’s Constitution also establishes key
      democratic principles of the separation of powers, equality and the institution
      of elections in Kazakhstan.\n\nSince independence, the Kazakh people have steadily
      built the values of Kazakhstan's democracy. Kazakhstan improved its positioning
      in international ratings. For example, in the Corruption Perception Index prepared
      by Transparency International Kazakhstan has shown continued rank improvement
      year over year. \n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img
      src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/img/kz/osce-alignment.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n\nSince
      its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan's democracy has consistently
      become more stable. [The transition to democracy](http://kznewsline.com/tag/kazakhstan-democracy/)
      in Kazakhstanresulted in the establishment of a Secular Constitution in 1995.
      Constitution, modeled after Western models of the separation of powers, outlines
      the responsibilities of the executive, legislative and judicial branches.  The
      executive power is under the President, the Government and the Ministries. The
      Senate and the Mazhilis control legislative powers. Lastly, the Constitutional
      Council and the Supreme Court control judicial power.\n\nThe first presidential
      elections in Kazakhstan were held in January 1999 with the election of former
      Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh (SSR) Nursultan Nazarbayev, who
      was subsequently re-elected in 2006 and in 2011 to serve for five-years, pursuant
      to a 2007 constitutional amendment that shortened the Presidential term by two
      years. This new amendment also reinforced the Parliament`s authority.  In early
      2009, a law was adopted on political groups that ensures the presence of at
      least two parties in Parliament. In January 2012, parliamentary elections were
      held using a closed, party-list system. President Nazarbayev’s party Nur Otan
      garnered 80.99% of the vote, followed by the Ak Jol party (7.47%) and the Communist
      People's Party of Kazakhstan (KNPK) (7.19%). The four opposition parties all
      received less than the required 7% minimum to qualify for representation in
      Parliament.\n\nThe Kazakh people on June 9, 2019 [elected](https://astanatimes.com/2019/06/tokayev-wins-kazakhstans-presidency-with-70-76-percent-of-vote-official-preliminary-results-say/)
      Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with 70.76% of the popular vote. Tokayev was one of [seven
      candidates](https://astanatimes.com/2019/05/seven-candidates-compete-for-countrys-highest-office-in-june-9-election/)
      running in the election. \n "

    title: Economy
    body: "Kazakhstan has quickly become a regional economic powerhouse thanks to
      its macroeconomic stability, improved business environment, and vast energy
      and mineral resources.\n\nThe Kazakhstan of today has made great strides considering
      the our country was built from the wreckage of the former Soviet Union. Kazakhstan
      has attracted more than __$250 billion in foreign direct investment since 1991__
      – the most of any former Soviet country. Kazakhstan’s economy grew by 10% annually
      in the ten years before the 2008 global financial crisis. At the time, Kazakhstan’s
      GDP was equal in size to the GDPs of all Central Asian and Southern Caucasus
      economies combined. \n\nKazakhstan has weathered the global financial crisis
      well through a dexterous response, combining fiscal relaxation with monetary
      stabilization. During the global economic crisis, Kazakhstan’s economic growth
      slowed down to 1.2% in 2009, while the annual growth rate subsequently increased
      to 5% and 6% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The country’s economic diversification
      and industrialization programs are expected to help economy maintain a healthy
      growth rate over the medium term.  Foreign trade turnover increased by 25 percent
      to __$69.5 billion__ in 2017. \n\n__Kazakhstan's modernization and economic
      development priorities include__:\n- modernization and a shift towards non-oil
      sources for economic growth;\n- industrial diversification, innovation, investment
      in human capital;\n- international trade integration for job creation;\n- Strengthening
      governance, the business-enabling environment, and private-sector enterprise.\n\nApart
      from oil and gas, infrastructure is another powerful driver of our economic
      development. Kazakhstan is the largest landlocked country, but strategically
      located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Kazakhstan has worked to be an
      integral and efficient part of regional transport and logistics systems. Since
      independence, transportation infrastructural projects became powerful drivers
      of economic development. The Kazakhstan Government has allocated about $ 9 billion
      for national transportation infrastructural strategies and programs, and that
      number will likely increase as the New Silk Road and One Belt One Road programs
      progress.\n\nOur goal is to serve as a land bridge between Europe and China.
      In a way, we are a gateway not only to Central Asia, but also to Eurasia. We
      have excellent relationship with EU and have made well known our goal to join
      achieve OECD membership. Kazakhstan signed an Enhanced Partnership Agreement
      with the EU, the only such agreement with a Central Asian nation. Kazakhstan

      and Investment Committee. \n\nThe United States is the second largest investor
      in Kazakhstan’s economy. Many American companies seek to invest in Kazakhstan
      for its  unique investment climate and good access to the Eurasian market. One
      of the pillars of our economic partnership with the United States is a history
      of success in areas of trade and investment, particularly in oil and gas and
      heavy manufacturing of locomotives. \n\nKazakhstan’s “brand perception” is at
      its highest in several years with increased awareness from established and non-established
      investors, especially in the areas of energy, industrial and automotive divisions,
      high-tech, telecommunication infrastructure and business. Established foreign
      investors in Kazakhstan view the country as the most attractive post-Soviet
      investment destination and highly value Kazakhstan's macroeconomic and sociopolitical
      stability, as well as its competitive corporate tax rate.\n\nThe Government
      of Kazakhstan has made significant efforts to remove bureaucratic obstacles
      to investment and the creation of an attractive business environment, which
      has been consistently reflected in the last three editions of the World Bank’s
      Doing Business report as well as other internationally recognized indices.  \n\n{%

      the state's fiscal balance, reduce the national debt, and aid the recovery of
      the banking sector following the 2007-08 crisis, prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade
      Kazakhstan's sovereign rating to BBB + with a stable outlook in November 2012.
      Similarly, Moody’s Investors Service revised Kazakhstan’s sovereign credit outlook
      to positive from stable in August 2013.\n\nKazakhstan’s business-friendly laws
      support the growth of foreign investment and stronger economic growth. In 2018,
      __FDI amounted to almost $25 billion__, the equivalent of 10% of GDP. FDI has
      introduced new forms of technology and jobs for domestic firms and subcontractors
      that partner with foreign entities, while transferring skills and know-how to
      the indigenous labor force. While the majority of FDI to date has been channeled
      into the oil, gas and mining sectors, and their associated services, the Government
      emphasizes promoting FDI into other industries in order to the country’s dependence
      on extractive industries, as part of its 2050 strategy.\n\nUnder Kazakhstan's
      steady development, the Kazakh people have experienced steady wage growth. Kazakhstan's
      per capita Gross National Income is above other Central Asian and Eurasian countries."

            Learning and Teaching Initiative (PILTI), which upgraded the technological
            capacity of thousands of secondary schools. Launched in 2007 by former
            Minister of Education and Science Zhanseit Tuimebayev, the PILTI aims
            to enhance the teaching of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
            by providing schools with a 21st century learning environment. To do that,
            education officials have assembled a team of the world’s top suppliers
            of innovative education products, including members of the UK consortium
            TVET UK and the California-based firm Pasco Scientific. In the less than
            five years since its launch, PILTI has facilitated the installation of
            new STEM and language teaching technologies in more than 20,000 classrooms
            across the country. More than 40,000 Kazakh teachers have been trained
            to use these new tools and incorporate them into a pedagogical method
            that emphasizes student participation, rather than lecturing.

      title: Bolashak Scholarship
      body: |-
        In 1993, Kazakhstan was the first Central Asian country to launch a presidential scholarship program, ‘Bolashak’, for international study. ‘Bolashak’, which means ‘future’ in Kazakh, speaks to the importance Kazakhstan puts on educating its youth at the best universities in the world. The Bolashak Programme is an all-expenses paid scholarship sponsored by awarded to high-performing students from Kazakhstan for graduate study at an overseas university. Upon completion of their graduate degree, Bolashak scholars are required to return to work in Kazakhstan for at least five years. The program is designed to train future leaders in business, international relations, law, science, engineering and other key fields.

        Since its implementation in 1993, more than 6,500 students have been awarded the scholarship, with most choosing to study in the United States and Great Britain.They have successfully graduated from America’s leading universities including Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Emory, Carnegie Mellon, Indiana University, Vanderbilt and many others.

    title: Gender Equality
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan strongly supports equal opportunities for women and considers gender equality not only a human right, but also an economic right. Women now contribute 40 percent of Kazakhstan’s GDP, and account for 52 percent of those engaged in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Women also make up 66 percent of individual entrepreneurs. 

      The 2011 Enterprise Survey’s country note on Kazakhstan says women were owners or part-owners of 34.4 percent of the country’s businesses and 28 percent of manufacturing companies held women ownership.  The [UNDP Country Programme Document for 2016-2020](http://www.kz.undp.org/content/kazakhstan/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/02/20/undp-hosts-consultations-with-government-on-2016-2020-country-programme-document-.html), a document drafted in partnership with the Government of Kazakhstan and the National Commission for Women Affairs, Family and Demographic Policy, focuses on more targeted support to women entrepreneurs, and to women who are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  

      __March 8 International Women's Day is a National Holiday in Kazakhstan__

      Kazakhstan is ranked #56 in the [United Nations Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/KAZ) and is #43 (out of 142 countries) in gender equality by the World Economic Forum 2014.

      20 percent of Kazakhstan's parliamentary ministers are women. In the 2015 ranking compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Kazakhstan ranks 47th (on a par with France) by percentage of women in national parliaments. Just for the sake of comparison, the United States comes at 76th, after Kenya and Saudi Arabia.

      Almost 34 percent of Kazakhstan's foreign service officers are women and 21 of them occupy senior executive diplomatic positions. [Akmaral Arystanbekova](https://www.kazakhembus.com/content/kazakhstan%E2%80%99s-first-un-representative-reflects-24-years-membership) served as Kazakhstan's first permanent representative to the United Nations from 1992-1999 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1989-1991.

      title: Nurly Zhol
      body: |
        First [President Nursultan Nazarbayev](http://kazakhstan-president.com/) in November 2014 announced a robust domestic stimulus policy titled ‘Nurly Zhol’ (Bright Path) that will drive state and foreign direct investment into critical infrastructure and priority sectors and drive economic growth. Nurly Zhol will total around $9 billion U.S. dollars and help to shift productivity towards agribusiness, manufacturing, trade and logistics, tourism, information technology and finance, and away from the oil sector. Importantly, Nurly Zhol will increase liquidity in the loans to small and medium sized business and domestic exporters. Nurly Zhol forecasts 4,500 new jobs by supporting SME growth.

        __Nurly Zhol targets seven areas of investment:__

        1. Development of transport and logistics infrastructure. Main road projects include those linking China to Western Europe, and Astana to Almaty. A logistics hub is being created in the east of the country, while marine infrastructure is being developed in the west.
        2. Development of industrial infrastructure. This includes the completion of infrastructure in existing special economic zones, and the construction of new industrial zones. The development of tourism infrastructure is expected to create many jobs.
        3. Development of energy infrastructure. The focus is on the construction of high-voltage lines spanning Ekibastuz, Semey and Ust-Kamenogorsk, and Semey to Aktogay, Taldykorgan and Almaty, with a view to ensuring a balanced energy supply.
        4. Modernization of public utilities infrastructure, and water and heat supply networks. In addition to the funds already budgeted for the modernization of heat and water supply systems, up to $540 million will be dedicated each year to accelerating the upgrades.
        5. Strengthening of housing infrastructure. Social housing will be constructed and made available for long-term rent with the right to buy. Low-interest loans and low mortgage interest will help make housing more affordable.
        6. Development of social infrastructure. An additional 20 billion tenge is being spent to reduce the deficit of kindergarten places. Ten higher-education institutions will also receive additional funding.
        7.  Support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and business activities. Loans totaling $837 million will help increase the output of the SME sector to 50 per cent of GDP by 2050.

        ### “KAZAKHSTAN-2050′′ STRATEGY: NEW POLITICAL COURSE OF THE ESTABLISHED STATE

        __The goal: preserving the nation’s high rate of economic growth.__

        In his [annual State-of-the-Nation address](http://strategy2050.kz/en/page/message_text2014/), President Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined a new strategy for Kazakhstan’s development through 2050, which is designed to serve as a coherent  continuation of the Kazakhstan-2030 Strategy.

        In his speech delivered on the eve of the country’s Independence Day, Nazarbayev announced  a series of milestone reforms in all spheres of the nation’s life. He laid out a strategy for the country, calling for better governance, improvement of the welfare and tax systems, support for small- and medium-sized businesses, and development of infrastructure.

        Currently ranked as the 51st most competitive country in the world, Kazakhstan, according to Nazarbayev, should be ranked among the 30 most advanced nations by 2050. To do so, Kazakhstan will need to integrate its economy into the global and regional environments by capitalizing on its transit potential and bolstering information technology capabilities.

        As an oil-rich country and a reliable international partner, Kazakhstan will lift the existing subsoil use moratorium in an effort to become “a regional magnet for investment.” This would be done in exchange for advanced technologies and the creation of new production.

        The President also tasked the government to increase the share of agriculture of the country’s GDP fivefold by 2050 through a series of measures including government stimulus packages. Nazarbayev asked the government to lift all licenses and permits not directly affecting safety in the first half of 2013. He also said it was necessary to redistribute responsibilities so a second wave of privatization of non-strategic enterprises can begin.

      title: SPAIID
      body: |-
        The State Program for Accelerated Industrial Innovative Development (SPAIID)is a short-term plan announced in 2010 to apply through 2014. Developed at the encouragement of President Nazarbayev in his 2010 State of the Nation Address, the program focuses on industrial and infrastructure development while also boosting diversification through small- to medium-sized businesses. 

        The program reveals the country’s strategy for diversification and involves the key approaches laid out in the Strategy of Industrial and Innovation Development for 2003-2015, and of the program “30 Corporate Leaders of Kazakhstan,” as well as other policy documents in the field of industrialization.

        For the period until 2015, the main priority of for industrialization will be the implementation of major investment projects in the traditional export-oriented sectors of economy along with the multiplication of new business opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses through the purposeful development of local content, subsequent conversion and processing.

        In order for Kazakhstan to become one of the world`s 30 most developed countries, Kazakhstan has to considerably innovate in the manufacturing of raw materials. In the manufacturing industry, an important number of innovative new projects will be developed with the help of foreign companies including IVECO (Italy), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (Japan) and Byelkamit (Italy-U.S.). In addition, the advent of the Customs Union and the EEU has helped the economy increase its exports of processed artifacts; for example, the size of vehicle-related manufacturing increased 24-fold since 2010.

        SPAIID was launched in 672 facilities in the past five years, creating 69,000 jobs and contributing $17.4 billion in manufacturing and $724.4 million in exports. Many industrial businesses were created across the country during the first half of 2014 alone, manufacturing products such as power lines, drill PDC bits, chemicals, and cement.

        SPAIDD has increased Kazakhstan’s production capacities and profoundly contributed to economic growth and development. Moreover, the program has maintained a sustainable employment rate, which helped the country overcome the intentional financial crisis starting 2008.

    title: Priority Sectors
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan is deeply committed to diversifying its economy outside of the lucrative energy and mining sectors. There are numerous other sectors where the country shows high growth potential in the coming years and the government is actively supporting investment in these areas through legal and financial means.

      In June 2014, Kazakhstan announced that foreign investors in non-energy sectors would receive a 10-year tax break on corporate and land taxes. Special Economic Zones that focus on priority growth sectors allow for additional investment benefits, such as exemptions for corporate income taxes and rent-free land for 10 years.

      The identified priority sectors are part of the government’s State Program of Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development (SPAIID), a cornerstone of its economic goals.

        - Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top 20 oil producers, with the ninth-most proven reserves in the world and about a 2% share in global production. 
        - Kazakhstan holds 30 billion barrels (four billion tons) of proven recoverable oil reserves and potential reserves of 100-110 billion barrels.
        - New projects being developed have led industry experts to estimate that by 2015, Kazakhstan will be one of the top five oil exporters in the world, with three million barrels per day.
        - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).
        - By 2011, Kazakhstan’s extractive industry made up about a quarter of the country’s GDP, while crude oil alone accounted for 60% of all exports. The oil sector currently accounts for more than half of all tax revenues.
        - Kazakhstan has made major investments to develop a Green Energy sector. President Nazarbayev has pledged that 50 percent of Kazakhstan's energy consumption come from green sources by the year 2050.
        - The country has 3% of the world’s raw materials and a natural resource base of over $300,000 per capita, which is among the highest in the world and is twice the level of Russia and higher than Australia.
        - It has 4% of the global iron reserves, 8% of the world’s zinc reserves and 4% of the world’s chrome reserves.

        Today new large-scale projects in the sphere of high processing of our natural resources are taking place.

        1) The Government has began the construction of the first module of the Balkhash Thermal Station with the power of 1320 MW and worth 2.3 billion USD, in order to solve the problem of energy shortages and energy dependency of the southern regions.
        2) One of the largest energy project in Kazakhstan is also the construction of the Moinak hydro-electric power station. The capacity of Bestyubinsk water reservoir is enough to store up to 300 million cubic meters of water. Two powerful hydro-turbines produce 300 megawatt of electric power.

        title: Oil & Gas
        body: |
          Kazakhstan’s oil and gas complex remains the powerhouse of our economy.

          - The share of the oil and gas sector within the country’s GDP has been growing at a steady rate, increasing from 3.7% in 1997 to 14.7% in 2006 and up to 25.8% in 2011.
          - Kazakhstan diversified its export markets and secured its position, thereby has reduced its dependence on any particular export direction.
          - In the early 1990s, President Nazarbayev had the foresight to create a fund, based on the Norwegian model, which preserved oil and gas revenues for our children and our grandchildren. This so-called “fund for future generations” has now accumulated over $47 billion and is the cornerstone to managing and preserving the country’s oil wealth.
          - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).

          The oil and gas sector represents a major dimension of the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral partnership. After all, in 1993, Chevron became the first major Western oil company to invest in Kazakhstan with the creation of TengizChevroil. Over the past twenty two years, Western energy firms and their advanced technologies have been essential to fueling the growth of Kazakhstan’s oil industry and uncovering some of the most challenging offshore, deep-sea energy deposits in the world.

        title: Renewables
        body: |
          - Kazakhstan has significant potential in renewable energy sector with its low population density and access to renewable energy sources such as wind, sun, and water.
          - The UNDP estimates that the potential for wind energy alone exceeds Kazakhstan’s current energy consumption by ten-fold.
          - The government aims for the share of renewable energy in domestic electricity generation to rise to 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
          - By 2020 the country should have 13 wind, 14 hydropower and four solar power plants, as well as a nuclear power plant.
          - In 2013 Kazakhstan adopted legislation establishing feed-in tariffs for renewables, which will be in place for 15 year, and provides capital subsidies.

          Together with Islamic Development Bank, the country has established a renewable energy fund of $50 million that hopes to attract strategic investment flows and expertize into renewable energy sector, particularly wind, solar, biomass and small hydro.

          In 2013 the government has launched a pilot version of the national carbon-trading scheme. In 2017, Kazakhstan will for the first time host the World Expo exhibition, dedicated to ‘Future Energy’. 

          __[Green Bridge](http://gbpp.org/en/)__
          Kazakhstan’s Green Bridge Initiative [was adopted](http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=1006&menu=1348&nr=2237) by the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development and aims to strengthen national and international governance, develop informational infrastructure, boost outreach and education, encourage green business and related technologies, introduce effective financial and economic mechanisms, and the creation of unified standards for the green economy.

          The Green Bridge targets conservation in five core sectors:

          - mountainous and wetland ecosystems,
          - sustainable energy (availability and efficiency),
          - food security,
          - urban infrastructure and transport,
          - adaptation to climate change and natural disasters.

          __[Expo 2017](https://expo2017astana.com/en/)__

          From June 10 to September 10, 2017 Kazakhstan’s Astana will be the first CIS city to host the World's Fair exhibition. For the first time EXPO will be dedicated to ‘Future of Energy’, facilitating discussion of the international community on innovation in energy and presentation of best practices in energy applications by experts. EXPO will make a significant contribution to the development and use of alternative energy sources globally, creating more environmentally-friendly economies as well as provide an impetus for Kazakhstan’s own transition to a green economy.

        After almost three years of stagnation in the Kazakhstani credit market, loans to the economy by banks had been renewed. The volume of  loans by banks increased by 15.7 percent and made up KZT 8.8 billion ($58.7 million). The volume of loans in the national currency increased by 29.6 percent and in foreign currency reduced by 3.4 percent.

        In order to increase the populations’ trust in banks and to activate the depositary market, the amount of individuals’ deposits coverage had been increased to KZT 5 million ($33,367).

        The National Bank carried out an additional capitalization of the Kazakhstan deposits insurance fund. As a result of these measures, deposits were raised by 19.7 percent in 2009 (9.7 percent without the devaluation effect), by 11.6 percent in 2010 and by 14.3 percent in 2011, to KZT 8.4 trillion ($56.0 billion).

      title: Mining & Smelting
      body: |-
        Mining represents 27% of the country’s GDP and has immense growth potential.

        70 elements have been explored and 60 extracted so far in Kazakhstan. Its mineral and resources base consists of 5,004 fields with a net worth of $46 trillion.

        Currently, the Industrialization Map of Kazakhstan includes 61 mining and smelting industry projects, with an investment of KZT 1.5 trillion ($10.0 billion). In 2011, 11 projects brought the economy a new worth of KZT 52.7 billion ($351.9 million) and 2,700 new jobs. The most significant of these include oil and gas, uranium, zinc, lead (2nd largest reserves in the world), manganese (3rd largest reserves in the world), and copper (5th largest reserves in the world).

        In terms of production, Kazakhstan is in third place of production of titanium, seventh for zinc, eighth for lead, thirteenth for iron ore, fifteenth for copper and thirty fifth for steel. Other mining operations in the country focus on tungsten, bohrium, silver, chromites, copper, fluorides, molybdenum, and gold. About 80 percent of all mining industry products are exported to more than 30 countries, making 20 percent of the total exports and 30 percent of the country’s revenues.

        To support the development of the mining and smelting industries, in 2010 the government approved the Mining-Smelting Industry Development Program for 2010-14. The program is aimed at rational and optimal use and development of mineral resources for the purposes of production of high-technology and science-intensive finished products. The government expects 107 percent growth of gross value added for metallurgy products.

      title: Agribusiness
      body: |-

        Agribusiness and agriculture combine to comprise a critical sector of the Kazakh economy. The rich soil and climate (similar to the U.S. state of North and South Dakota and Nebraska) provide ideal conditions for growing wheat, barley, rice, corn, millet and buckwheat and raising livestock - especially American [Black Angus](https://www.inquisitr.com/382988/transplanted-north-dakota-cattle-doing-well-in-kazakhstan/). Kazakhstan’s major crops are wheat, barley, cotton, and rice.  Kazakhstan is one of the top 10 grain exporters in the world, exporting to over 70 countries.

        For a country with a long nomadic history, it is not surprising that stockbreeding is the traditional and dominant agricultural sector. No less than three quarters of all agricultural land is used for grazing. Sheep breeding is predominant, while cattle breeding and the raising of pigs, horses and camels are also well developed. Animal husbandry typically accounts for about 45-50 percent of the production value in agriculture in Kazakhstan. Primary meat products include beef, veal, chicken, horse, lamb, pork and rabbit.

        The livestock sector is gradually growing. Meat production increased by 8% to 270,550 tonnes in 2018. Kazakhstan produced 535,501tonnes of milk in 2018, which is a 10% increase compared to 2017.

        The Government provides subsidized loans to agricultural enterprises, subsidies for machinery upgrades and construction, state-funding of organizations developing veterinary and phytosanitary sectors, the provision of subsidies for industrial energy costs. It also waved import duties on farm equipment, raw materials and spare parts, and exemption from corporate income and property taxes. According to the 2018 data, international investors have tripled their activity in agricultural business since 2004.

        title: Land Code Reforms
        body: |-
          Kazakhstan recently made reforms to the existing agriculture land codes to encourage foreign direct investment into the priority sector. The new codes will drive investment into Kazakhstan's rural communities, create modernized agricultural jobs, increase transparency by making public the details of land auctions, and add up to 15 years to the land leases available to foreign investors. Kazakhstan's land code reforms better position Kazakhstan to support its commitment to [Food Security](http://kazakhstanun.com/kazakhstan-un-security-council/) and providing stability to global food markets.

      title: Transportation & Logistics
      body: |-
        Being sandwiched between Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan boasts of a great transit potential, as there is no alternatives for Asian states to link to Russia and Europe. Relatively diverse landscape and availability of natural stone reserves allow unrestricted development of railways and automobile routes.

        Four international transport corridors cross the territory of Kazakhstan and are formed on the basis of transport infrastructure existing in the country. They are:

        - __Northern Corridor of Trans-Asian Railway Main (TARM)__: Western Europe – China, Korean Peninsula and Japan via Russian and Kazakhstan (section Dostyk – Aktogai - Sayak – Mointy – Astana – Petropavlovsk (Presnogorkovskaya)).
        - __Southern Corridor of TARM__: South-Eastern Europe – China and South-Eastern Asia via Turkey, Iran, Central Asian states and Kazakhstan (section Dostyk – Aktogai – Almaty- Shu – Arys – Saryagash).
        - __TRACECA__: Eastern Europe – Central Asia via the Black Sea, Caucasus and the Caspian Sea (section Dostyk – Almaty – Aktau).
        - __North-South__: Northern Europe – Gulf States via Russia and Iran, with Kazakhstan’s participation in the following sections: sea port Aktau – Ural regions of Russia and Aktau

        Kazakhstan Government has elaborated and approved Strategy of Transport Sector Development of up to 2015; the amount of investments required for construction of respective infrastructure within the 10 years will make up USD 26 billion.

        Ultimate goal of the Transport Strategy is to ensure progressive development of transport and communications complex in line with economic strategy of the state. The Strategy covers 2006-2015 and is supposed to be implemented in two stages: 1st stage – 2006-2011, 2nd stage – 2011-2015.

        The Strategy implementation is expected to ensure bringing of the national transport system to a higher level, and forming of an optimum transport network. Financing of the infrastructure on the self-sufficiency principles will allow accommodating resources for its further sustainable development and maintenance at a high technical level.

        On Feburary 1, 2016 a new container train service on the China-Iran route via Kazakhstan was launched. The 9,000-kilometre route runs from the city of Yiwu (Zhejiang Province, East China) through the Alashankou-Dostyk border crossing to Kazakhstan’s new Zhezkazgan-Beineu and Uzen-Bolashak lines and via Turkmenistan’s railway network to Tehran. With only a 10-day transit time, the 40-foot containers on the train can travel much faster overland than by sea, which takes from 25 – 30 days. In establishing the new service, the railway companies of China, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran collaborated to identify logistics solutions needed to speed up the delivery of cargo from East China to Persian Gulf markets.

        Kazakhstan is well-positioned to develop a chemical production sector through its wealth of raw materials. Petroleum-related downstream products, such as phosphates and sulfuric acid, are part of this focus. The pharmaceutical sector will take advantage of the high level of scientific and educational development in the country’s southeast area.

        With vast oil reserves and raw chemical material deposits, Kazakhstan has huge growth potential in the petrochemical industry. In 2004, the government adopted the “__Program for development of the petrochemical industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2008-2013__,” pursuant to which it has started constructing the National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark in Atyrau that will convert the resources from Tengiz and Kashagan oil fields to high-value petrochemical products for export and domestic consumption.

      title: Information Technology (ICT)
      body: |-
        Technological innovation is at the forefront of efforts to diversify Kazakhstan’s economy. The government aims to become a major technological hub in Central Asia, focusing on ICT.

        Kazakhstan’s strategic location between China and Europe allows for it to play a critical linking role between these economic giants, as well as acting as the communications hub for fast-growing Central Asia.

        __The Park of Information Technologies in Alatau__, a special economic zone, has been established to facilitate transfer of technology and foster innovation.

        The local demand for high-quality telecommunication infrastructure and services, particularly Internet access and data transfer services, is increasing with rapid economic and social progress. There is a demonstrated market demand for a more agile technological infrastructure, included upgraded telecommunications networks in rural and urban areas and enhancing broadband Internet access.

        While there are international firms working on these projects, Kazakhstan is interested in attracting the high-tech expertise of U.S. companies.

      title: Manufacturing
      body: |-
        The production of machine equipment is vital to Kazakhstan’s development and relates to several other core economic goals, such as the growth of the energy and mining sectors as well as infrastructure.

        Manufacturing that serves the country’s booming construction sector is also a high-growth opportunity and the gross value-added amount for Kazakhstan’s industrial engineering sector in all of 2008 was equaled in the first half of 2013, a sign of the machinery sector’s booming growth.

        Machinery constitutes an important share of the Kazakhstan’s non-agricultural imports from the US. In 2013, machinery represented $333 million of the non-agriculture imports from the US (which totaled $882 million the same year).

        Kazakhstan’s pharmaceutical market, on the other hand, is the most accessible, transparent and, from a legislative point of view, progressive in Central Asia. Currently, some 70% of domestically consumed medicine is imported, while 30% are internally manufactured. 

        The government adopted a resolution on “__The State Program for the Development of Pharmaceutical Industry for 2010-2014__,” with the objective of increasing domestic production of pharmaceuticals from 30 to 50% by the end of 2014. Under the program, foreign manufactures are eligible to obtain equal treatment with domestic ones if they decide to produce domestically.

    title: Religious Freedom
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan is a multi-confessional secular state that guarantees constitutional freedom of worship and religion to each of its 46 religious denominations. Kazakhstan has earned international recognition for its promotion of religious freedom and belief as well as its efforts to tackle intolerance and discrimination both on domestic and international levels. Indeed, the absence of any inter-faith conflict since the independence more than 25 years ago is a testament to these efforts.

      The country’s 3,088 religious organizations are all free from government interference while the country’s leadership engages religious leaders on important social and cultural matters to foster peace and religious accord. Leaders of the largest religious associations are members of the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, the Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and local government organizations. There are more than 2,500 places of worship of diverse religions, including 2,268 mosques, 162 Russian Orthodox churches, 86 Roman Catholic churches, and 614 Protestant Christian churches. The Kazakh Jewish community has synagogues in Almaty, Astana, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kostanai, and Pavlodar.

      Kazakhstan’s religious freedom, diversity, tolerance, and its location on the crossroads of Europe and Asia make it an ideal country to facilitate global inter-faith conversation. The country has worked with partners on a bilateral and multilateral basis to develop a dialogue among civilizations and religions. Since 2003, every three years the country hosts the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. The forum welcomes Muslim, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and other religions’ representatives and aims to nurture discussion on how the spiritual and moral potential of world religions can be used to prevent international conflicts and address global threats, xenophobia and intolerance. Kazakhstan aims to have the forum function as a permanent international organization mandated with the implementation of decisions taken collectively by influential spiritual leaders.

      Kazakhstan cooperates with the United States in the human rights and religious freedom protection. One of the platforms for effective dialogue is the [Annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom](https://www.state.gov/ministerial-to-advance-religious-freedom/) hosted by the U.S. Secretary of State. The [1st inaugural Ministerial](https://blogs.state.gov/stories/2018/07/27/en/united-states-hosts-first-ever-ministerial-advance-international-religious) was held on July 24-26, 2018. The 2nd Ministerial took place on July 16-18, 2019. Kazakhstan delegation was led by Minister of Information and Social Development Mr Dauren Abayev.

      Within the United Nations framework Kazakhstan has been [actively promoting](https://astanatimes.com/2015/02/dialogue-peace-harmony/) inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue. In 2005 Kazakhstan was one of the main sponsors of the UN Resolution on Promotion of Inter-religious Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace. During the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures in 2010, initiated by [First President Nursultan Nazarbayev](http://kazakhstanun.com/discover-kazakhstan/kazakhstan-president-nazarbayev/) in the 62nd session of the UN General Assembly, more than 1000 events were held around the world by member states, international and regional partners and UNESCO. Building on the success of this initiative and with Kazakhstan’s advocacy, the UN General Assembly then adopted a resolution proclaiming the years 2013-2022 the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures.

      Kazakhstan has used its presidencies of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) in 2011 and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2010 as platforms for strengthening West-East dialogue. During the OSCE presidency Kazakhstan hosted High-Level Conference on Tolerance and non-Discrimination in Astana to promote the values of tolerance, non-discrimination inter-cultural dialogue.

      All these efforts reflect the country’s commitment to promotion of peace, harmony, and religious tolerance.

    title: Culture
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse in the world. This owes in part to its geography, situated in between the major world religions, but also to Soviet ethno-policies and the settlement of European migrants throughout the 20th century. Ethnic and religious tolerance have deep roots in Kazakhstan: It was in this part of the Islamic world where the Sufist tradition of Islam earned some of the strongest positions, and Kazakh nomads are known for their hospitality and openness to external influences.

      Today, Kazakhstan hosts nearly 130 different ethnic groups and 17 different religious confessions. In 2010, the ethnic Kazakhs accounted for 65% of the population, the Russians 25.9%, with the remainder being spread among Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars, Uyghurs, Byelorussians, Azeris, Turks, Koreans, Dungans, Poles, Greeks, and other ethnic groups. In the 2009 Census, 70% of Kazakhstan’s population identified themselves as Muslim and 26% Christians, which corresponds roughly with the share of peoples of Asian and European origins in Kazakhstan’s polity. While historically divided into zhuzes and smaller tribal formations, ethnic Kazakhs still view themselves in terms of a single body or - in popular parlance - “branches of the same Kazakh tree”. 

      <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/seven-facets/" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

      During the Tsarist Empire’s colonization in the 19th Century, more than a million settlers from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus came to the territories comprising modern day Kazakhstan. In the late 1920s and 1930s, Soviet collectivization and industrialization prompted the migration of an additional 1.4 million Europeans. In total, around 800,000 Germans, 185,000 Koreans, 102,000 Polish, 507,000 North Caucasians, and sizeable numbers of Crimean Tatars, Turks, Greeks, and Kalmyks were deported to Kazakhstan under Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin. Kazakhstan’s diverse society is an integral part of its nationhood. Thus, “the huge potential for integration into Kazakh culture for every ethnic group of the country”, President Nazarbayev has noted, “may be realized only through the open character of the Kazakh culture itself”.

      title: Alphabet
      body: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree October 26, 2017
        to modernize the existing Kazakh alphabet to Latin-based script, and amended
        his decree in February 2018 to better modernize some characters. President
        Nazarbayev announced his intention to switch from the Cyrillic-based alphabet
        to Latin script in April 2012. The new alphabet consists of 32 letters and
        letters of the old Cyrillic alphabet will be replaced by Latin analogues based
        on their phonetic similarity. Kazakhs used Arabic script from the 10th-20th
        centuries. The Kazakh language was based on Latin script in 1929-1940. The
        transition to the Cyrillic alphabet occurred in 1940. The Latin alphabet is
        currently used by most Kazakh diasporas abroad.

      title: Ethnic Groups
      body: |-
        The population of Kazakhstan is various by its ethnical compound. Representatives of 130 nationalities live here. The local ethnos – Kazakhs make the largest part of the population – 58.9%, while Russian – 25.9%, Ukrainians – 2.9%, Uzbeks – 2,8%, Uighur, Tatar and German - 1.5% each, and other groups 4,3%. There are more than 100 ethnic groups living in peace in Kazakhstan.

        Many nationalities have come to Kazakhstan not on their own will, but were driven here by political repression and persecution. In Stalin’s times Kazakhstan hosted 1.5 million of political prisoners from Russia and other regions of the USSR. And more than 1.3 million of people were deported by Stalin regime during World War II years “as representatives of unreliable nations”. All these people found understanding and support of Kazakh people, found their second Motherland on the land of Kazakhstan.

        The principle of equality of all ethnic groups that inhabit our country is strictly adhered by. All conditions for a full national self-expression have been created as well as the rights for the fulfilment of their ethno cultural interests are ensured. Legal guarantees and respectful treatment of all the languages used in the republic defend the integral right of citizens of any nationality to develop their language and culture. Figures witness the balance and harmony of the national policy: about 40% of secondary schools use Russian language in teaching. The higher education for 70% is available in Russian language. In areas of residence of compact ethnic groups schools function with Uyghur, Tajik, Ukrainian, German, Polish and other languages of teaching.

        The Sunday schools of national and cultural unions also receive support in the teaching of native languages. Today 30 languages of ethnic groups of Kazakhstan are taught in about 200 Sunday schools and 3 schools of national revival. Magazines and newspapers are published, TV and radio programs are broadcast in 11 national language in Kazakhstan. Books in the languages of ethnic minorities of Kazakhstan are published annually on the state order with a total number exceeding 80 000. Besides Kazakh and Russian theatres there are also Uyghur, German and Korean ones.

        Ethnic cultural centres have been established in all areas of Kazakhstan, to support ethnic identity of different nationalities. Their highest forum is the Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. Today this powerful social force has become an organic part of the civil society and expresses its views in the chambers of the Parliament, political parties, mass-media, state and non-government organizations. The Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan has become an important element of the political system of Kazakhstan. It has forged the interests of all the ethnos and ensures the rights and freedoms of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion. 27 republican and regional, more than 300 district ethnic cultural unions enter the Assembly of people of Kazakhstan. Three centres have an international status. The Assembly deals with 16 Small Regional Assemblies of peoples of Kazakhstan which act as consultative bodies by the regional administrations and comprise representatives of local ethnic-cultural and social unions.

        Kazakhstan’s efforts to ensure inter-ethnic peace and accord are essential for internal stability and are widely recognized in the world. The Pope as well as UN General Secretary Koffi Annan who paid visits to our country over the last five years cited Kazakhstan as the example of inter-ethnic consent and sustainable development of a multi-ethnic society. The interethnic policy is based on the principle of unity in variety. The civil peace and consent in Kazakhstan are the result of a persistent policy of the Government which enjoys the support of the whole society.

            value: Many nationalities have come to Kazakhstan not on their own will,
              but were driven here by political repression and persecution. In Stalin’s
              times Kazakhstan hosted 1.5 million of political prisoners from Russia
              and other regions of the USSR. And more than 1.3 million of people were
              deported by Stalin regime during World War II years “as representatives
              of unreliable nations”. All these people found understanding and support
              of Kazakh people, found their second Motherland on the land of Kazakhstan.

              to support ethnic identity of different nationalities. Their highest
              forum is the Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. Today this powerful
              social force has become an organic part of the civil society and expresses
              its views in the chambers of the Parliament, political parties, mass-media,
              state and non-government organizations. The Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan
              has become an important element of the political system of Kazakhstan.
              It has forged the interests of all the ethnos and ensures the rights
              and freedoms of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion.
              27 republican and regional, more than 300 district ethnic cultural unions
              enter the Assembly of people of Kazakhstan. Three centres have an international
              status. The Assembly deals with 16 Small Regional Assemblies of peoples
              of Kazakhstan which act as consultative bodies by the regional administrations
              and comprise representatives of local ethnic-cultural and social unions.

              essential for internal stability and are widely recognized in the world.
              The Pope as well as UN General Secretary Koffi Annan who paid visits
              to our country over the last five years cited Kazakhstan as the example
              of inter-ethnic consent and sustainable development of a multi-ethnic
              society. The interethnic policy is based on the principle of unity in
              variety. The civil peace and consent in Kazakhstan are the result of
              a persistent policy of the Government which enjoys the support of the
              whole society.

      title: Horse Culture
      body: "Strong evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5919/1332\">Botai
        civilization</a> was the first to domesticate the horse. Research and analysis
        of escavated pottery and other artifacts has coalesced the opinion that the
        ancient inhabitants of what is modern-day Kazakhstan used horses to aid them
        with their day-to-day lives.  \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/horse-culture/\"
        width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\"
        frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n## Significance of the Horse in Kazakh Culture\n\nWhile
        the people of the Great Steppe had tamed horses thousands of years ago, the
        horse, its symbolism and history are woven into the fabric of Kazakh culture
        and modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\nThe world cultural community recognizes the
        unique and special role equines have in Kazakh culture. UNESCO has included
        the __traditional Spring Festive Rites of Kazakh horse breeders__ on the Representative
        List of the [Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of Humanity](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-spring-festive-rites-of-the-kazakh-horse-breeders-01402).
        \n\nPreceded by year-long preparations, the the Spring Festive Rites of Kazakh
        Horse Breeders include: \n\n- __Biye baylau__ (tethering mares), the ancient
        first milking rite encompassing the separation of mares and foals from the
        herds, milking the mares and celebrating with songs, dances and games. \n-
        __Ayghyr kosu__ (the stallion’s marriage), a rite for adjoining stallions
        in herds to commence a new breeding season. \n- __Kymyz muryndyk__ the opening
        of the Spring season's Kymyz sharing rite and marks the season's production
        and sharing among other families. Kymyz, pronounced \"koumiss\", is a fermented
        mare's milk beverage. \n\n<div class=\"d-flex justify-content-center\">\n<iframe

        picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Sayis - National
        Horse Racing Games\n- __Kokpar__\nThis game consists of two teams of horse
        riders. The objective is for the team to gather a goat carcass and bring it
        to their part of the playing field, past a designated line. Each time tries
        to do this as many times as possible to gain points.\n- __Audaryspak__\n  The
        objective of this game is quite simple: two horsemen must wrestle and attempt
        to push each other off of his saddle. \n- __Kyz kuu__ \n  In this game, a
        horseman tries to catch a girl on a horse galloping at full speed. He has
        to do this before she reaches the finish line. If he catches her, he may kiss
        her. But, if he loses, the girl must catch him and whip him (playfully, of
        course).\n- __Kumys-alu__\n  This game is quite easy to grasp, too. A horseman
        must gallop on his horse and attempt to pick up coins scattered on the ground.
        The rider gets to keep the coins he gathers as a prize.\n- __Tenge alu__ \n-

      title: Holidays
      body: "### January 1-2 – New Year\n\n### March 8 – International Women’s Day\n\nIWD
        is a global day celebrating the economic, political and social achievements
        of women past, present, and future.\n\n### March 22 – Nauryz (Traditional
        holiday of Spring, ancient Turkic New Year)\n\n“Nauruz”, Persian for “New
        Year”, is a time for family and friends to celebrate, cherish the past memories,
        and anticipate a better year. To rejoice in the end of the harsh winter and
        welcome the spring, relatives gather around a table and exchange gifts. All
        who join in the festivities, however, must have accomplished the following
        goals:\n\n- Asked for forgiveness of their sins\n- Liquidated their debts\n-
        Revived themselves spiritually\n- Physically reconciled with relatives and
        friends.\n\nSimilar to the Persian New Year, the number ‘7’ is significant
        for Kazakhs. For instance, the main ritual dish, “Nauryz-kozheh,” includes
        seven ingredients:\n\n- Water\n- Meat\n- Salt\n- Fat\n- Flour\n- Cereal\n-
        Milk\n\nThese seven ingredients signify the seven life beginnings:\n\n- Joy\n-
        Luck\n- Wisdom\n- Health\n- Wealth\n- Speedy growth\n- Heavenly protection\n\nEveryone
        must visit seven houses and invite seven guests.\n\nDuring the day, Kazakhs
        shout, “Koktem tudy!” (Spring is born!) in the streets, squares, parks and
        stadiums. There are plenty of activities to participate in or observe, including:\n\n-
        Horse-racing\n- Kazakhsha-kyres (national sport in which men wrestle while
        riding a horse)\n- Kokpar (team contest of rider groups trying to seize and
        take possession of a slaughtered goat’s body)\n- Ethnic theater\n- Fashion
        shows\n- Parades (marches that teach visitors about the Kazakh culture and
        the importance of respecting other countries).\n- Nauryz concert 2011\n\n###
        May 1 – Unity Day\n\nThis day marks the anniversary of the meeting held in
        1726 between three local Kazak elders (biis), Tole Bi, Kazybek Bi, and Aiteke
        Bi. Fearing the threat of invading Dzhungars, the three sought to reunite
        their hordes to create a stronger, more effective defense. President Nazarbayev
        has indicated that the success of these men in uniting the Kyrgyz and Uzbek
        tribes should inspire the process of establishing peace in Central Asia.\n\nIn
        today’s world, Unity day is celebrated as a form of Labor Day: a day of national,
        regional, and global solidarity. Within the borders of Kazakhstan, many associations,
        unions, and communities of ethnic groups exist peacefully, including but not
        limited to Poles, Romanians, Hungarians, Greeks.\n\n### May 9 – Victory Day\n\nCelebrated
        since 1947, Victory Day marks the surrender of Nazi Germany to the Soviet
        Union in World War II. It was first inaugurated in the fifteen republics of
        the Soviet Union, following the signing of the surrender document on May 9,
        1945.\n\n### July 6 - Astana Day\n\nOn July 6 Kazakhs celebrate the \"birthday\"
        of their capital - Astana (Astana was renamed to Nur-Sultan in March 2019).
        \n\n### August 30 – Constitution Day\n\nConstitution Day is a public holiday
        honoring the day Kazakhstan signed and adopted their Constitution.\n\n###
        December 16 – Independence Day\n\nIn just a short span of time, Kazakhstan
        has managed to become a stable, powerful, and well-respected nation. In honor
        of the past 18 years of independence, celebrations will be held throughout
        the country, including concerts, conferences, exhibitions, and feasts."

              Fearing the threat of invading Dzhungars, the three sought to reunite
              their hordes to create a stronger, more effective defense. President
              Nazarbayev has indicated that the success of these men in uniting the
              Kyrgyz and Uzbek tribes should inspire the process of establishing peace
              in Central Asia.

      title: Literature
      body: "Abay Kunanbaev (1845-1904). Abay was born in 1845 at the bottom of the
        Chingiz Mountain in the today's Abai district (former Karkaraly) located in
        Eastern Kazakhstan region (formerly, the Semipalatinsk region).\n\nHe was
        a well-known Kazakh poet, a great thinker, composer, philosopher, the founder
        of written Kazakh literature, and its first classic.\n\nThe heritage he left
        his nation is rich in songs and poems, translations and prose. His translations
        of the poetry written by Russian writers and poets such as Pushkin, Lermontov,
        and Krylov became the national patrimony of Kazakhstan. He translated the
        works of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron into Kazakh language.\n\nAbai Kunanbaev
        is the Shakesphere of Kazakh literature.  His [Book of Words](http://kazakhworld.com/abai-kunanbaev-book-of-words/),
        «Kara Sozder», created by the great thinker constitute an ethnic philosophical
        work. This creation of his is an exploration of Kazakh national life in the
        second half of the 19th century. He influenced social affairs in the country
        where he lived.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/abai-slides/\"
        width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nHe also participated
        in the governing of the country and played a certain role in trying to solve
        complicated problems justly.\n\nThe name of Abai is known worldwide just as
        Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin are well-known in many countries, because
        his great words became a spiritual patrimony of not only one nation, but of
        the entire humankind.\n\nAbay's main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore
        lies in his poetry, which expresses great nationalism and grew out of Kazakh
        folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing the nomadic
        habits of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abay's lifetime, however,
        a number of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred.
        Russian influence continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational
        possibilities as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether
        Russian, Western or Asian. Abay Qunanbayuli steeped himself in the cultural
        and philosophical history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense,
        Abay's creative poetry affected the philosophical thinking of educated Kazakhs.\n\nThe
        leaders of the Alash Orda movement saw him as their inspiration and spiritual
        predecessor.\n\nContemporary Kazakh images of Abay generally depict him in
        full traditional dress holding a dombra (the Kazakh national instrument).
        Today, Kazakhs revere Abay as one of the first folk heroes to enter into the
        national consciousness of his people. Almaty State University is named after
        Abay, so is one of the main avenues in the city of Almaty. There are also
        public schools with his name.\n\nContent from [adebiportal.kz](https://adebiportal.kz/en/authors/view/2679) "

        __Tourism in Kazakhstan - The Land of Wonders__

        Kazakhstan is a unique region in the world, because of its history, geographical position and size. Being the world’s 9th largest country and located in the centre of Eurasia, it is also the largest landlocked country in the world. These resulted in a specific climate and a peculiar natural system of the country, which seems to absorb the brightest examples of landscape of both continents. In addition, complicated history of Kazakh people and constant interaction of nomadic lifestyle with settled people in South Kazakhstani ancient cities, have lead to a unique and authentic culture of Kazakhstan.

        These peculiarities have created an opportunity to develop various and diverse offers for travel and tourism in Kazakhstan, which include authentic cultural tourism,nature-based activities, including ecotourism, birdwatching, etc. in national parks and protected areas, skiing or trekking in mountains, water sports, sunbathing andswimming in lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan, and many others. 

        __Nature-based tourism__

        Diversity of natural areas has contributed to rich flora and fauna of Kazakhstan. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 species of birds and 107 species of fish; and over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves were established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.

        The most famous of them among tourists include Aksu Zhabagly Nature Reserve, which is a habitat of snow leopard and other rare animals, and is also known as a Kingdom of Tulips, where tulips are believed to originate, long before they were introduced in Holland; Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve is famous for its pink flamingos and other rare species of wildlife, and popular among bird-watchers; Altyn Emel National Park is interesting for its mystery of Singing Dune; Katon-Karagay National Park is a habitat of marals (red deers), unossified antlers of which are used as a precious medicine. 

        __Mountains: Trekking and winter sports__

        A range of high, middle and low mountains, such as Tien Shan, Altay, Ulytau, Kazygurt, etc. have a beautiful nature attracting tourists from all over the world. Tien Shan Mountains is the highest among them (with the highest peak of about 7000 metres), and Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, is located at its bottom. Thus, an easy access to marvelous landscapes for tourists interested in trekking and winter sports is available from Almaty city.

        Most popular climbing routes are located in the Small Almaty Valley and Bogdanovich Glacier. Attractions of these places include Pogrebetsky Glacier (4,231 meters), Tuyuc Su (4100 m), Ordzhonikidze (3980 m) peaks, and many others. In addition, high mountains of Kazakhstan are ideal for winter sports. There is no wonder that Kazakhstan hosted Winter Asian Games in 2011: one of the priorities of the country has been propaganda of winter sports.

        A unique sport complex Medeu (sometimes spelled as Medew or Medeo), with a skating rink popular among tourists, was built in 1950’s, at 1691 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest skating rink in the world. A sophisticated artificial refrigeration system enables to keep high quality ice coverage over 8-months of the year. Another major winter sport attraction of Kazakhstan is Shymbulak (Chimbulak) ski resort, also located not far from Almaty. Snow lies in these places from November till May; however, sunny weather is usually registered there during more than three hundred days each year. The resort hotel can accept up to 114 tourists. 

        __Lakes and rivers: water sports, sunbathing and health resorts__

        Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.
        Coast of the biggest lake in the world – Caspian Sea is perfect for sunbathing, swimming and fishing. The largest number of reservoirs is concentrated in the south-east part of the country, in the region with a symbolic name Zhetysu - “Seven Rivers”. Almost all the rivers of Zhetysu belong to the basin of Lake Balkhash, which is also a popular tourist destination for its health centres and recreation camps. Besides health resorts, rafting in mountain rivers for extreme tourists, boating and sailing in lakes are only a few examples of activities offered for tourists in Kazakhstan.

        __Culture: ethnotourism__

        Unique culture of Kazakhstan is a reason to travel to Kazakhstan for many tourists. Almost in every corner of the republic, a visitor, interested in real life of Kazakh people - their traditions, rituals, art and culture, will find many things of interest. These include museum complexes, ethno villages, depicting traditional lifestyle of Kazakh people, historical sites of medieval cities and many others.

        For example, tourists are offered to experience traditional lifestyle of Kazakhs, to try national dishes and to interact with the local people in Shabanbay Bi Village, situated in Kyzylaray Mountains, Central Kazakhstan. Zhambyl Zhabayev museum complex in Almaty region includes a house with a garden, where the poet lived in XIX-XX centuries and a mausoleum. This is a visual representation of not only Zhambyl’s life, but also of a whole era in which the poet lived and worked. South Kazakhstan is famous for ancient cities located at the routes of the Great Silk Road with historical monuments and other sites.

        Ethno-memorial complex Map of Kazakhstan - Atameken, located in Astana, is the largest ethnographic park in Kazakhstan and a unique outdoor museum. Cities and landscapes of the country, as well as mini copies of main attractions and historical sites can be found on the map.

            value: A unique sport complex Medeu (sometimes spelled as Medew or Medeo),
              with a skating rink popular among tourists, was built in 1950’s, at
              1691 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest skating rink

              Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.

        title: Nur-Sultan
        body: "Nur-Sultan is located in the center of Kazakhstan in the dry steppe
          zone and in the grass steppe subzone. The area of the city stands above
          the flood plain. The Yessil River is a major waterway of the capital. The
          city has an extreme continental climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan
          hosted the 2017 world's fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana
          Expo 2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s favourable location in
          the centre of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically advantageous
          transport, communication and logistics centre, and a natural bridge between
          Europe and Asia.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yrqt_3Po2LE\"
          frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
          picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe transfer of the capital
          to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
          high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
          in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for
          10 percent, while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2
          percent.\n\nThe city has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan.
          \n\nEntrepreneurship is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are
          more than 128,000 small and medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan
          is among the leading cities of the country in terms of the volume of construction.
          After the city became the capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres
          of housing facilities have been built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan
          and abroad took part in the construction of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural
          concept of Nur-Sultan was based on the idea of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying
          a special Eurasian style of Nur-Sultan should harmoniously combine the cultural
          traditions of both the East and the West. A well-known Japanese architect
          Kisho Kurokawa became the author of the general layout of the capital city.\n\nToday
          Nur-Sultan, located in the heart of Eurasia, is a venue for numerous international
          forums, congresses and large scale international events. The Congress of
          Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, the Astana Economic Forum and
          other forums are held regularly in the city. In December, 2010, the historical
          Summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe took
          place in the capital city of Kazakhstan, after which it hosted the anniversary
          summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Organisation of Islamic
          Cooperation. In early 2011, the city welcomed the participants and guests
          of the 7th Asian Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted the international
          specialized exhibition EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military district
          was founded in 1832 on the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods.
          Until 1961, the name of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and
          because of its ideal location, it soon turned into a central point for trade
          livestock fairs. In 1961, the name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola
          in 1992. Astana was not the official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital
          was renamed to Nur-Sultan after the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan
          Nazarbayev.\n\n### Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s
          area was over 300 sq. km., but today, the city boundaries are rapidly expanding.\n-
          The distance between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the former capital, is 1,318
          km.\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s population was about 300,000. This year (2009),
          the population has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn 1997, the President
          of Kazakhstan made the decision to relocate the capital of Kazakhstan from
          Almaty to Akmola city (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n- Advantageous
          geopolitical location\n- Considerable industrial potential\n- Crucial resources
          for subsequent development of the construction industry\n- Location in the
          largest transport junction\n- Essential transport and telecommunication
          infrastructure\n- Highly skilled urban workforce\n- Large private sector\n-
          Potentialities for entrepreneurship development\n- Political and social
          stability\n- Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe most important
          reason for moving the capital and expanding and improving the city of Nur-Sultan
          was to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically stable
          and prosperous, democratically viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt
          Nur-Sultan’s historical inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From
          now on any major decisions important for the future of the people will be
          made here in the centre of this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland
          is beating here. Kazakhstan is making and defining its history and destiny
          here and today.”\n\nIn 1998, the decision was made to officially change
          the name of the new capital Akmola to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year
          later, the Astana from waterUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
          Organization (UNESCO) granted the status, “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe
          city’s rapid growth as the administrative and business center of the country
          matches the original concept for social and economic development. The theme
          of this concept is “The blossoming of Astana is the blossoming of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More
          than 200 joint ventures and foreign companies are operating in the capital,
          including those belonging to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Kyrgyzstan\n-
          Switzerland.\n \nAstana is a member of the International Association of
          Capitals and Cultural Cities of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS);
          it also has close bilateral relations with 13 cities and regions of the
          CIS.\n\n__The growth of Astana, as a result of it becoming the new capital,
          has had a powerful influence on neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n-
          Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n- East Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also
          supported the development of entrepreneurship and businesses which will,
          in turn, lead to the opening of foreign companies, firms, and major bank
          branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business Magnet__\n\nAstana is
          a major center of activity and the hub of national and international transport
          links. The extensive traffic is mainly due to strong economic ties between:\n\n-
          South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The
          Volga region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government
          have spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and
          2004, the number of new legal entities registered in the capital more than
          doubled, and the local housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers
          of the capital city’s economic activity are:__\n\n- Construction\n- The
          food industry\n- Tourism\n\nThe city boasts a growing number of restaurants
          and hotels that cater to business travelers. Major exhibition centers and
          universities, such as the L. Gumilyov Eurasian University, can be found
          within Astana. The A. Barayev Research Institute of Grain Farming is another
          establishment, not only famous in Kazakhstan but within the scientific world.
          In addition to the three museums, Astana also has branches of the Union
          of Writers and Artists of Kazakhstan, with over 40 newspapers and two literary
          magazines being published in the city.\n\n__Tourist Attractions__\n\n__Astana’s
          tourist attractions include:__\n\n- Astana-Baiterek, a monument to the country’s
          independence with a sweeping view of the city\n- A circus\n- An ethnic park\n-
          A presidential culture museum\n- The world’s most inland aquarium\n- A 10,000-seat
          skating stadium and cycle track.\n\nAdditionally, Astana is fast becoming
          a mecca for sports tourism; new sport centers are planned for the neighboring
          areas of Korgalzhyn and Ereimentau.\n\n__Culture and the Arts__\n\nThe Presidential
          Cultural Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established in the center
          of Astana. The structure of the Center includes a museum Cultural Centerwith
          various rooms and displays representing Kazakhstan’s past and present values.
          In addition, the Center has a library containing more than a million books
          and electronic catalogues.\n\nThe Kazakh National Music Academy has also
          been established in Astana. This Academy combines specialized and general
          musical education into one school. The Academy is a member of the European
          Association of Conservatories, Academies and Musical High Schools.\n\n__Spectators
          enjoy visiting theaters such as:__\n\n- The Theater of Drama and Music,
          named after K. Kuanyshbaev and opened on November 15, 1991\n- The State
          Theater of Russian Drama, named after M. Gorky\n- The National Opera and
          Ballet Theater, named after K Baiseitova and opened in Cinema City2000.\n\nIn
          addition to theaters, the pristine new cinema complex, Cinema-City, was
          opened in 2000. It was built in the tradition of international cinemas and
          has become a favorite of the people of Astana.\n\n__Eighth Wonder of the
          World__\n\nIn September 2006, the inauguration of the Palace of Peace and
          Accord (62 meters in height), also known as the Peace Pyramid, marked another
          milestone in Astana’s evolution and may well become the Eighth Wonder of
          the World. Built to house the Assembly of Nations of Kazakhstan, a university,
          a museum, a library and a winter garden, the pyramid was designed by British
          architect Sir Norman Foster, who is famous for his futuristic glass roof
          on the German Parliament, the Reichstag.\n\n__Special Economic Zone__\n\nConstruction
          of the new city developments on left bank of the Esil River has started.
          To aid in this process, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ), providing more
          favorable conditions for investment, has been created. According to the
          General Development Plan of the Capital, the integrated structure of this
          complex, located on the left bank, will symbolize the new capital.\n\n__The
          creation of the SEZ will provide many benefits to both the state and potential
          investors, including:__\n\n- State support of direct investments into construction
          of Astana city\n- Significant tax privileges and preferentials\n- Opportunities
          to introduce modern technologies and scientific achievements in the field
          of construction\n- Land for construction in the new center of the capital\n-
          Formation and development of the real estate market\n- Guaranteed right
          to prolong the investment activity on the initial terms, until the expiration
          of the SEZ period. This cannot exceed ten years, irrespective of the changes
          in the juridical regime of the SEZ or its liquidation before the appointed
          time, including the extension of the area. \n\nThe Customs regulation in
          the territory of the SEZ is applied in accordance to the customs legislature
          of Republic of Kazakhstan. The territory of the SEZ is considered to be
          a part of the customs-free territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n__The
          following goods and equipment are customs-free:__\n\n- Machines and equipment
          for construction\n- Goods that will be completely consumed in construction\n-
          Goods and equipment necessary for construction.\n\n__Products__\n\nThe region

          machine-building. In fact, it produces:\n\n- One-fifth of all grain\n- One-tenth
          of cattle-breeding products\n- One-fourth of grain being sold to the country.\n\nLand
          being used for crops constitutes 3,422.6 hectare (ha), a metric unit of

          raw products. The region is fairly active in conducting foreign economic
          activities; it maintains mutually advantageous relations with many countries,
          including the major trade partners of:\n\n- Russia\n- Uzbekistan\n- Belarus\n-

          in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its territory is approximately
          96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape is far from uniform, as hills intermingle
          with low mountains, plains, and river valleys. In the North is found the
          Kokshetau summit; in the southern and south-eastern portions of the region

                the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods. Until 1961, the
                name of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and because of
                its ideal location, it soon turned into a central point for trade
                livestock fairs. In 1961, the name was changed to Tselinograd, then
                to Aqmola in 1992. Astana was not the official name until 1998. In
                2019, the capital was renamed to Nur-Sultan after the First President
                of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.

              value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its
                territory is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape
                is far from uniform, as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains,
                and river valleys. In the North is found the Kokshetau summit; in
                the southern and south-eastern portions of the region is the Saryarka,
                part of the Kazakh topography; and plains compose the North-East.

          To promote tourism, Kazakhstan enforced a “Law on Tourism” (1992) that embraces virtually all types of tourism. __The law also addresses key issues of tourism activities:__

          - Legal
          - Economic
          - Social
          - Organizational

          In addition to this law, the Government has adopted several enactments concerning tourism concerns, including a number of documents that regulate the licensing of tourism activities. In 1993, the National Program for developing Kazakhstan’s tourism industry was adopted, and in 1997, the Government passed the State Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, designed to accomplish the following goals:

          - Regenerate historic centers of the Great Silk Route
          - Preserve and development the cultural legacy of Turkic-speaking states
          - Create the tourism infrastructure from 1997-2003.

          Additionally, Kazakhstan became a member of the World Tourism Organization in 1993.
          The Committee for Regulation of Trade and Tourist Activity, a branch of the Ministry for Industry and Trade, is the body that manages tourism in Kazakhstan. Certain executive departments and tourism representatives from other countries carry out the administration of this committee.

          In 1997, Kazakhstan created the Strategy of tourism development, intended to be intact through 2030. Today, 430 tourism agencies, firms, and bureaus of various property forms function effectively in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They employ nearly 6,000 people and 1,500 professional guides. Kazakhstan tourism firms cooperate with almost 80 countries of the world; approximately 25 tourism firms in Almaty and five in regional centers arrange charter flights to the following countries:

          - India
          - Turkey
          - The United Arab Emirates
          - Pakistan
          - South Korea
          - Greece
          - Poland.

          There are also cooperative agreements with the following places:

          - Turkey
          - Iran,
          - The Xinjang Uigur Autonomous Area of China
          - Moldova
          - Hungary
          - The State of Israel
          - Kyrghyzstan
          - Egypt

          In addition to those already in place, Kazakhstan is in the process of making intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements with other nations, including:

          - Croatia
          - Pakistan
          - Singapore

          Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in United Kingdom tourists over the past few years, and with the recent visa simplification procedures (letters of invitation are no longer required of EU and US citizens) still greater numbers are expected.

      __Important milestones in the history of Kazakhstan__

      Kazakhstan has a long and fascinating history, going back thousands of years. Some remnants are still visible today such as Great Silk Road monuments, petroglyphs and sometimes even mysterious archaeological sites[^4]. The Amazons might have originated from Kazakhstan, the first steppe nomads are supposed to have emerged from here and it is very likely that Genghis Khan was buried in Eastern Kazakhstan.[^2] In recent times more and more details about Kazakh history and culture have been re-discovered, making the country also more and more interesting for domestic and international culture seekers.

      The territory of Kazakhstan came to be mastered by man nearly a million years ago[^3]. As early as the age of the Lower Paleolithic, ancient man settled down on these Karatau lands fit for normal life, rich with game and wild fruit. It is here that they have found ancient settlements from the Stone Age. By and by, in the centuries of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, man came to master Central and Eastern Kazakhstan and the Mangyshlak area.

      As has been shown by excavations of the Neolithic settlement Botay in Northern Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan constitutes a region of [horse domestication](/about-kazakhstan/culture/horse-culture) (breeding) and that of the formation of nomadic civilizations. Archeologists have revealed dwellings and numerous hand-made articles of stone and ivory which present the ancient history and archeology of Kazakhstan in the Stone age in an altogether new way.

      As early as the Bronze Age, some four millennia ago, the territory of Kazakhstan was inhabited by tribes of the so-called Andron and Begazy-Dandybay culture. They were engaged in farming and cattle-breeding, and were fine warriors who handled combat chariots marvelously. To this day we can see images of chariots drawn on rocks where ancient people would arrange their tribal temples and sanctuaries with the firmament as their natural cover. On the surfaces of black cliffs burnt with the sun people would chisel out scenes of dances, images of sun-headed deities, mighty camels and bulls as impersonations of ancient gods.

      Burial mounds of noble warriors scattered all throughout Kazakh steppes are known for the magnificent size both of the mounds and burial vaults proper. Particularly famous are such necropolis in the steppes of Sary-Arka and Tagiskent in the Trans-Aral area. People of that epoch were not only fine warriors, shepherds and farmers but also skilled metallurgists. They would take bronze and manufacture axes, knives, daggers and various decorations thereof.

      It was they who initiated the development of copper which is being practiced to this day - they are the Zhezkazgan and Sayak copper mines of today. Ancient people lived in large settlements and ancient towns surrounded with walls and towers.

      These towns were inhabited by warriors and craftsmen, priests and farmers. These tribes lived on the territory of Kazakhstan for about a thousand years - from the 17th century B.C. to 9th-8th centuries A.D.

      Later on they were ousted by the Saks. Such was the name given to this tribe by ancient Persians. The Chinese called them "se" whereas Greeks chose to call them Scythians. They were essentially nomads, semi-nomads and farmers. Yet, first and foremost, they were excellent horsemen. In fact, Saks were the first ever horsemen in the world to master arrow-shooting at full speed.
      In the 5th-2nd centuries B.C., the Saks set up their first state with its center in the Zhetysu(Semirechje) in South-Eastern Kazakhstan. The kings of the Saks were at the same time high priests. Saks had a written language and a mythology of their own; they were known for their well developed art of world standard labeled in research papers as "animal-styled art". Respective subjects were represented by predators and herbivorous animals and the struggle there between. Sheer masterpieces made of gold and bronze serve as worthy exhibits in the best museums of the world. The linguistic situation was just as complicated. As is traditionally believed, in the course of the first millennium B.C., the population of Kazakhstan was mostly represented by native speakers of Indo-European and Indo-Iranian languages. However, of late, they are inclined to think that the tribes of the Bronze Age, particularly those of the Saks, included tribes that spoke proto-Turkic languages.

      In the Issyk burial mound which harbored the world-famous "Golden Man" they have found a silver bowl whose bottom bore an inscription consisting 26 characters. They have failed to read it to this day. Some think that the inscription is made in one of the Iranian languages, others insist on its proto-Turkic origin. In any case, this must be the very period that highlighted the formation of the state of mind and the language of medieval and modern Kazakhs, their physiological stereotypes, in fact, of many an element of their culture, everyday life and folk rites.
      The middle of the first millennium A.D. is a fairly important stage in the history of all Turks in general and Kazakhs in particular. The period is marked with manifest changes in ethnic media: predominant now become Turkic tribes which chose the Altai as their natural center. Written sources of the 6thcentury register the term "Tyurk" which is pronounced as "Tutszyue" by the Chinese and as "Turk" by the Sogdians.

      Archeological studies of Turkic monuments make it possible to somehow compare "these" Turks with certain Turkic tribal associations. In the Sayano-Altai region they have identified certain archeological cultures which might well be likened to early Kyrgyz, early Kypchaks or early Oguzes. In the course of not infrequent internecine wars, tribal discord, and struggles for power and pasture, a part of the Turkic tribes which inhabited the steppes and valleys of Kazakhstan moved southwards - to Central Asia (say, Tyurgeshes, Karluks, Kypchaks, Uzbeks, Oguz, and Turkmens-Seldzhuks), to Asia Minor, to the Caucasus (Turkmen and Seldzhuks), and to Eastern Europe (Kangars and Pechenegs, Kypchaks-and-Polovtsians, Torks-and-Oguz, black Klobuks and Karakalpakians).

      Starting from the 4th century up to the beginning of the 13th century, the territory of Kazakhstan was the seat of West-Turkic, Tyurgesh, Karluk Kaganates, of the state made by the Oguz, Karakhanides, Kimeks and Kypchaks. All of them successively replaced one another right up to the Mongol invasion. After the invasion, i.e. in the beginning of the 13th century, uluses of the Mongol Empire of Zhuchi-Khan and Zhagatai were formed, which later gave birth to Ak-Orda, Mongolistan and finally to the Kazakh Khanate.
      Essentially all these states were mixed economies. Tribes of cattle-breeders had farming tribes as their neighbors, and steppes and cities supplemented each other. Such cities as Taraz, Otrar, Ispijab, and Talkhir were set up right in the middle of the Great Silk Road, which served as a reliable link joining antiquity and the Middle Ages, the West and the East: Japan, Korea and China with Central Asia, Iran, the State of the Seldzhuks, Rus, Byzantium, France and Italy.

      It is through the Great Silk Road that dancing arts, painting, architecture and music made their way from one people to another. Incidentally, it was the way along which various religions advanced: Manichaeism and Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, with the latter becoming predominant (starting from the 8th century) and subsequently the solitary faith of the Kazakhs. In the late 14th-early 15th century, on the banks of the Syrdaria River in the city of Turkestan, they erected a religious sacred place worshipped by all Turkic-speaking nations - the complex of Khodja Akhmed Yasavi.

      The nation that inhabited the territory of Kazakhstan would avidly absorb and assimilate all the ideas and achievements of various civilizations, making - in its turn - its own contribution to the treasury of world culture, be it economy or handicraft or music: among numerous accomplishments one may name the mobile dwelling "yurta", saddles and stirrups for horses, combat arts on horse-back, carpet ornaments and silver jewelry, sweet melodies and music reminding one of the impetuous gallop of steppe horses...
      All these factors have determined the integrity and continuity of the ancient and medieval history of Kazakhstan.

        ### Why Celebrate 550 Years of Kazakh Statehood?

        Words, particularly names, can have a great power. Astana means “capital” in Kazakh. The name was suggested by President Nursultan Nazarbayev and has now become one of the brands strongly associated with the Republic of Kazakhstan.

        But what about “Kazakhstan” itself? There was a discussion a year ago about the President’s proposal to consider renaming the country “Kazakh Yeli”. The great monument on Independence Square in Astana actually bears that name. And “Kazakh Yeli” actually means “the land of Kazakhs” or “Kazakhland”. Just as Deutschland, Poland, Finland and Thailand is a simple description of who, mostly, lives in each country. In fact, “Kazakhstan” has exactly the same meaning as “Kazakh Yeli”, but in Persian (with “stan” meaning land). So where did this name of the sovereign state, which has been a member of the United Nations for the last 23 years, come from?

        History textbooks tell us that the first use of the word “Kazakh” dates back to the late 13th century. It is considered to be of Turkic origin and means “a free man”, i.e. “someone who left his tribe or clan to live a life of an adventurer.” Many scholars believe that Russian word for “Kazak” meaning “Cossack” most likely originated from the same word.

        When back in 1459 several clans followed Sultans Kerey and Zhanibek in defiance of Khan Abulkhair Sheibanid, the powerful ruler of “nomadic Uzbeks”, and migrated out of their native land to the valleys of rivers Shu and Talas, they were called “Kazakhs”, in the pejorative meaning of being“outsiders”. The union of tribes led by Kerey and Zhanibek quickly grew in numbers and strength throughout 1460s and 1470s, “Kazakh” gradually became a name associated with the people behind the new military force and, subsequently, the name of the state that developed from it.

        The key source on Kazakh khanate’s early history – Mirza Mukhammad Khaidar Douglat’s study “Tarih-i-Rashidi”, written between 1541 and 1546, labelled the new state “doulat-i kazak” (the Kazakh state). For a few decades in the late 15th century and the first decade of the 16th century, the heirs of Abulkhair Khan Sheibanid, or Uzbeks as they were known then, challenged the legitimacy of the Kazakh rulers’ claim to the title of khan. Unsuccessful in these efforts,  they instead conquered the fertile lands between the Central Asia’s two largest rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya, known frrom the earliest times to the Iranians as “the lands beyond the river (Amu Dariya)” or Maverannakhr in the Arabic language. Having settled there, the Sheibanids dropped their ambition to “punish” their “rebellious” cousins. From around  1510, and well into the mid-19th century, the territory  to the north of the agricultural lands of Syr Dariya valley, were ruled by those who claimed the title of “khan” and lineage from Kerey and Zhanibek, and thus from Genghis Khan.

        That those rulers were recognized as “legitimate” holders of the title is confirmed by the Russian colonial administration’s acceptance of  the practice, long after most Kazakh clans and their leaders came under the Tsar’s protectorate in  mid-18th century, and well into the first quarter of 19th century (the reforms of 1822-1824 cancelled the administrative references to Kazakh Khans, although in 1841-1847 the rebellious sultan Kenessary Kassymuly was recognised by most Kazakhs as their Khan).

        It was around 1562 when the Kazakh khanate first became known in Western Europe. It appeared as “Cassackia” on a map drawn by Anthony Jenkinson, an English diplomat and traveller, to fill in the area between “Tashkent” and “Siberia”. Even if Jenkinson never visited this part of the Great Steppe, he was likely to learn about the Kazakh khanate from the Russians, as he was the English Crown’s first ambassador to Moscow during the time of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.

        A state of nomadic people has notable differences from that of a people with settled populations inhabiting towns and villages. Because of the nature of their economy, the nomads did not have much access to writing materials to document their everyday lives. This, of course, hampered the development of a proper tax system to fund the functioning of the administration. It also explains why there are fewer historical sources shedding light on the developments in nomadic states like the Kazakh khanate. However, a rich oral tradition flourished and the Kazakh language now has few regional differences, despite more than 3,000 kilometres of distance separating western and eastern Kazakhs and more than 1,500 kilometres those living in northern and southern parts.

        There was also less division of labour in nomadic societies. Because nomads do not live in settlements, there were no schools with specialised education. Enforcement of court decisions was problematic and was often based on voluntary acceptance of the punishment since there were no prisons and plenty of space into which to escape. Nor did a permanent army exist. The reality was leaders had little difficulty in quickly assembling a capable military force in case of a conflict or a war.

        These factors naturally proved to be historical weaknesses that eventually led to the end of nomadic states between 17th and 19th centuries. The settled populations were more advanced and more powerful.  But this does not deny the nomadic political entities their status as states.

        In the case of Kazakhs, between 1465 and 1822, there was a distinct population of “Kazakhs”, whose rulers held the titles of “khans.” They were recognised descendants of the history’s most powerful conqueror, Genghis Khan, with legitimacy to rule. This history shows the statehood of the “Kazakh people”.

        Today most members of the United Nations are nation-states. The issue of “nation” is a more complicated and nuanced than a “state”. It will most likely remain a subject of heated academic debate for the foreseeable future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised. Kazakhstan, as most other political entities in the world, positions itself as a “nation-state.” The preamble of its Constitution begins with the statement, “We, the people of Kazakhstan, united by a common historic fate, [are] creating a state on the indigenous Kazakh land.” So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the entire population, which has lived through historic experiences that have united “the people of Kazakhstan”. The clear reference to the “indigenous” Kazakh land links the modern state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

        According to Ernest Gellner, the definition of nationalism is “primarily a political principle, which holds that political and national unit should be congruent.” Gellner relied on German sociologist Max Weber’s definition of state, i.e. “political unit”, as an agency which has a monopoly of ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have a political unit of “The Republic of Kazakhstan”, what is a “national unit”? It is clear that the initial national unit that created the very idea of Kazakhstan were the ethnic Kazakhs.

        There is an argument, though not particularly mainstream, that the political unit of Kazakhstan is not congruent with the national one. It claims that Kazakhstan’s contemporary borders are artificial and were simply drawn up by Bolsheviks, while the nation of “Kazakhs” was artificially modelled on Stalin’s imagination of “national policies”. But it is hard to see what the evidence to support this view is.

        It is true, of course, that many modern nations in Asia and Africa bear traces of purposeful modelling along the lines drawn from the 19th century European and American experiences of nation-building. But a nation is rarely sustainable without some “ethnic” origins – a bond through people who have inhabited the particular territory for generations and feel connected to the land.  Otherwise, the attempt to create a nation-state is most likely to fail.

        This bond is what helps define the modern nation of Kazakhstan. It was “modelled” to reflect the living historical bond with the Kazakh people and their heritage. Borders of the nation with this name took shape mainly in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created. The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions came after protracted debates involving the representatives of local communists. These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)” movement, which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial autonomy for Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

        The borders they proposed were based on the most relevant demographic and statistical data of the time, such as the census of the Russian Empire’s population in 1897. According to this census, speakers of “Kirgiz-Kaisak”, –  the Kazakh language – numbered more than 4 million people at the time and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial” borders of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s politically stable development must be due to this congruence between the “national” and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the early 1920s.

        The 20th century, however, has turned Kazakhstan into a multiethnic, multicultural society that it is today. A major change in the country’s demographic structure was shaped by several waves of mainly voluntary, economically motivated migrations of Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians) and some Turkic groups (Tatars, Uighur, Uzbeks), along with the Stalin era’s involuntary resettlements of Germans, Poles, Koreans, Chechens, and other Caucasian peoples.

        Kazakhstan’s good fortune is that, despite these shake-ups, these diverse groups have lived in harmony with each other. The country has experienced no major conflict along ethnic or religious lines. Moreover, the hardships of forced collectivisation, being part of the Soviet Union’s grand war effort against Nazi Germany, post-war reconstruction, and then the break-up of the USSR and the difficult adaptation to a free market economy that followed,  all brought the people of different ethnicities closer together, strengthening tolerance and the need for mutual understanding and solidarity. These challenges have helped unite them into a single group – “the people of Kazakhstan”. Whether you call it a “Kazakh nation”, in line with international thesaurus, is a matter of a secondary importance.

        Then why at all celebrate the Kazakh khanate’s anniversary? For the same reason people mark anniversaries of a major past event all around the world. It is an opportunity to remind ourselves of our background,  reflect on the journey of our culture and strengthen the understanding of who we are. The celebration of 550 years of the Kazakh khanate will help further unite all of us who chose to live in the land of the Kazakhs as one “people of Kazakhstan” and will strengthen our links with this land.

              language now has few regional differences, despite more than 3,000 kilometres
              of distance separating western and eastern Kazakhs and more than 1,500
              kilometres those living in northern and southern parts.

            value: There was also less division of labour in nomadic societies. Because
              nomads do not live in settlements, there were no schools with specialised
              education. Enforcement of court decisions was problematic and was often
              based on voluntary acceptance of the punishment since there were no
              prisons and plenty of space into which to escape. Nor did a permanent
              army exist. The reality was leaders had little difficulty in quickly
              assembling a capable military force in case of a conflict or a war.

              eventually led to the end of nomadic states between 17th and 19th centuries.
              The settled populations were more advanced and more powerful.  But this
              does not deny the nomadic political entities their status as states.

            value: In the case of Kazakhs, between 1465 and 1822, there was a distinct
              population of “Kazakhs”, whose rulers held the titles of “khans.” They
              were recognised descendants of the history’s most powerful conqueror,
              Genghis Khan, with legitimacy to rule. This history shows the statehood
              of the “Kazakh people”.

            value: Today most members of the United Nations are nation-states. The
              issue of “nation” is a more complicated and nuanced than a “state”.
              It will most likely remain a subject of heated academic debate for the
              foreseeable future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised.
              Kazakhstan, as most other political entities in the world, positions
              itself as a “nation-state.” The preamble of its Constitution begins
              with the statement, “We, the people of Kazakhstan, united by a common
              historic fate, [are] creating a state on the indigenous Kazakh land.”
              So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the entire population, which has
              lived through historic experiences that have united “the people of Kazakhstan”.
              The clear reference to the “indigenous” Kazakh land links the modern
              state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

            value: According to Ernest Gellner, the definition of nationalism is “primarily
              a political principle, which holds that political and national unit
              should be congruent.” Gellner relied on German sociologist Max Weber’s
              definition of state, i.e. “political unit”, as an agency which has a
              monopoly of ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have
              a political unit of “The Republic of Kazakhstan”, what is a “national
              unit”? It is clear that the initial national unit that created the very
              idea of Kazakhstan were the ethnic Kazakhs.

              one. It claims that Kazakhstan’s contemporary borders are artificial
              and were simply drawn up by Bolsheviks, while the nation of “Kazakhs”
              was artificially modelled on Stalin’s imagination of “national policies”.
              But it is hard to see what the evidence to support this view is.

              century European and American experiences of nation-building. But a
              nation is rarely sustainable without some “ethnic” origins – a bond
              through people who have inhabited the particular territory for generations
              and feel connected to the land.  Otherwise, the attempt to create a
              nation-state is most likely to fail.

              It was “modelled” to reflect the living historical bond with the Kazakh
              people and their heritage. Borders of the nation with this name took
              shape mainly in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic
              was created. The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions
              came after protracted debates involving the representatives of local
              communists. These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)”
              movement, which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial
              autonomy for Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

            value: The borders they proposed were based on the most relevant demographic
              and statistical data of the time, such as the census of the Russian
              Empire’s population in 1897. According to this census, speakers of “Kirgiz-Kaisak”,
              –  the Kazakh language – numbered more than 4 million people at the
              time and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial”
              borders of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s
              politically stable development must be due to this congruence between
              the “national” and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the
              early 1920s.

              demographic structure was shaped by several waves of mainly voluntary,
              economically motivated migrations of Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians)
              and some Turkic groups (Tatars, Uighur, Uzbeks), along with the Stalin
              era’s involuntary resettlements of Germans, Poles, Koreans, Chechens,
              and other Caucasian peoples.

              the hardships of forced collectivisation, being part of the Soviet Union’s
              grand war effort against Nazi Germany, post-war reconstruction, and
              then the break-up of the USSR and the difficult adaptation to a free
              market economy that followed,  all brought the people of different ethnicities
              closer together, strengthening tolerance and the need for mutual understanding
              and solidarity. These challenges have helped unite them into a single
              group – “the people of Kazakhstan”. Whether you call it a “Kazakh nation”,
              in line with international thesaurus, is a matter of a secondary importance.

      class=\"img-fluid qazio-image-embed mx-auto\">\n\n\nSince its independence from
      the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has consistently moved towards a stable,
      democratic transition, which resulted in the establishment of a secular constitution
      in 1995. The constitution, modeled after Western models of the separation of
      powers, outlines the responsibilities of the executive, legislative and judicial
      branches. The executive power is under the President, the Government and the
      Ministries. The Senate and the Majlis control legislative powers. Lastly, the
      Constitutional Council and the Supreme Court control judicial power.\n\n<img

      class=\"img-fluid qazio-image-embed mx-auto\">\n\n__President__\n\nThe President
      of the Republic elected through a direct, popular vote for a five-year term.
      The Constitution enables the President to appoint the Prime Minister, with Parliament’s
      approval. The President may propose constitutional amendments, veto laws, and
      dissolve Parliament during a national crisis. The President is entrusted by
      the Parliament all legislative powers with a majority of two thirds of both
      chambers. He has the right to veto laws, which can only be countered by a majority
      of two thirds of each chamber. The President has the authority as the Supreme
      Commander of the armed forces to make final decisions on national security and
      defense.\n\n__Parliament__\n\nThe bicameral Parliament is composed of the Senate
      and the Mazhilis. The Senate includes forty seven deputies. All fourteen regions,
      plus the cities of Astana and Almaty, elect two representatives to serve for
      six-year terms, with half of the Senate up for election every three years. The
      President appoints the remaining fifteen deputies. The Majilis, with 107 members,
      makes up the lower house of the legislative branch. 98 members are elected by
      proportional representation to serve five-year terms, and the Assembly of Peoples
      of Kazakhstan chooses nine members.\nThe [Assembly of Peoples of Kazakhstan](https://assembly.kz/en/)
      gathers prominent representatives from the country’s 140 ethnic groups. The
      Assembly’s nine representatives in the Parliament are responsible for representing
      the interests of the other 373 members of the Assembly of Peoples.\n\nThe Parliament
      has the right to take initiatives but those having budgetary implications must
      be submitted to the Government for approval. Proposed bills are first approved
      by at least two-thirds of the Majilis before they are sent to the Senate for
      consideration. If at the bill is approved by at least two-thirds of the Senate
      within sixty-days, the bill is sent to the President for his signature. However,
      in case they are rejected, they are returned to a second review by the Majilis
      who must then vote by a majority of two thirds before returning the bills again
      to the Senate. The Parliament also approves the President’s appointment of the
      Prime Minister.\n\nAt the regional level, Maslikhats are local executive bodies
      elected in each of the fourteen regions for two-year terms through direct elections
      based on the principles of universal suffrage. Maslikhats are in charge of social
      issues and under the supervision of “Akims”, who are regional prefects appointed
      by the president.\n\n<img id=\"women-in-politics-in-kazakhstan\" src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/infographics/women-in-politics.jpg\"

    title: Sherman House
    body: |
      ![sherman-house](//images.ctfassets.net/3u75lz35gn9w/1YvDc7vQJ0OFa5WFa0mJkP/b16c92ec8f42e8b35f8b7035f11baae3/sherman-house.png)
      Built in 1888, Washington, D.C.’s “Sherman House,” is home today to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the United States.  The spacious, brick, Richardsonian-style house has had some notable tenants, but none more so than __U.S. Vice President James S. Sherman__, the 27th Vice President of the United States. Sherman served as President William Howard Taft’s vice president and remains the only vice president ever to have died in office.

      ![James Sherman-651x814](//images.ctfassets.net/3u75lz35gn9w/2n1mS5uUlKV16Kfujtb7Wp/0d09096a128ef390b3923c81aefeace9/James_Sherman-651x814.png)

      The Sherman House features a massive hip roof, prominent chimneys and a distinctive round corner tower. The house was designed and built by Charles and Samuel Edmonston for Susan Shields, the widow of a wealthy newspaper publisher. The Edmonston’s familiar design style is reflected in many of the Dupont Circle neighborhood’s most enduring apartments and homes.

      To honor the Sherman tradition of open-door hospitality, diplomats fromKazakhstan go to great lengths welcome and entertain official visitors as well as the general public, who are always welcome to tour the inside of the house. Not only is the exterior of the Embassy wonderful, but the inside is well-appointed with rich, dark woodwork, high ceilings and ornate staircases. The Embassy is much like the country itself in that it welcomes anyone through its door and visitors can view the Kazakh artwork, jewelry, statues, and cultural attire on display inside, including a room designed to resemble the interior of a traditional Kazakh yurt, or nomadic tent.

      The “Sherman House” is a small slice of American history. Since its construction, the house has served as a place of fellowship, dialogue and the open exchange of ideas. Appropriately, Kazakhstan’s modern day diplomats have embraced Sherman’s open-door policy to and used it to strengthen relations between Kazakhstan and the United States.

      For a tour of the Sherman House, please schedule your visit by sending a tweet to __@kazakhembassy__ or posting to the [Embassy of Kazakhstan in Washington, D.C.’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Embassy-of-Kazakhstan-in-Washington-DC/151137401613963?fref=ts).

      title: Strategic Partnership Dialogue
      body: "Kazakhstan and the United States in 2010 launched the __Annual Bilateral

        Kerry met on December 10, 2014 in Washington, D.C. The two sides highlighted
        the robust and growing bilateral ties between Kazakhstan and the United States

        and democracy and civil society strengthening. The U.S. welcomed Kazakhstan's
        human rights progress, particularly the Consultative and Advisory Body Dialogue
        Platform on Human Dimension.\nThe first session of the fourth SPD was held
        on November 2, 2015, when Secretary Kerry visited Nur-Sultan. The sides discussed
        counter-terrorism measures, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and regional security.
        The next session of the fourth SPD was in Washington, D.C. on March 9, 2016.\n\nThe
        fifth SPD took place on September 20, 2016 in New York City, on the margins
        of the 71st United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister Idrissov and
        Secretary Kerry assessed that the strategic partnership between the two countries
        has never been stronger.\n\nThe ESPD convened most [recently](http://mfa.gov.kz/en/content-view/-1825

      body: |-
        Kazakhstan rule of law initiatives are points of partnership with the United States and European Union. The US has introduced the American Corners program to promote American culture and the English language. Under the program, the US has opened educational centers located in the cities of Almaty, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Karaganda, Shymkent, Uralsk, Atyrau, Petropavlovsk and Aktobe. With the US government help Kazakhstan has developed a robust network of civil society organizations that provide important services to the population, advocate the constituent rights and engage on key policy reform issues. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) works with local organizations to promote human rights, media developments, legal reforms, and women’s rights.

        Kazakhstan cooperates with the United States on initiatives to protect human rights and religious freedom at home and abroad. One of the platforms for effective dialogue is the [Annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom](https://www.state.gov/ministerial-to-advance-religious-freedom/) hosted by the U.S. Secretary of State. The [1st inaugural Ministerial](https://blogs.state.gov/stories/2018/07/27/en/united-states-hosts-first-ever-ministerial-advance-international-religious) was held on July 24-26, 2018. The 2nd Ministerial took place in Washington, D.C. on July 16-18, 2019. The Kazakh delegation was led by Minister of Information and Social Development, Mr Dauren Abayev.

    body: "Kazakhstan has attracted significant foreign investment since independence.
      The U.S. is one of Kazakhstan's most important economic partners. Bilateral
      cooperation is affirmed by one-on-one meetings between presidents. Most recently
      Presidents Trump and Tokayev meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly
      in September 2019, and then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev visited the White
      House in January 2018. There exists bilateral resolve to strengthen cooperation
      in trade and investment, security and people-to-people relationships within
      the framework of an [Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-kazakhstan-enhanced-strategic-partnership-21st-century/).
      Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was sworn in as the new President of Kazakhstan on
      March 20, 2019, reaffirmed his commitment to continue the country's foreign
      and economic policy. \n\n<div class=\"usa-alert usa-alert-info\" >\n  <div class=\"usa-alert-body\">\n

      Nursultan Nazarbayev and U.S. President Donald Trump during the former’s official
      visit to Washington in January 2018, as well as business meetings with Kazakh
      President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in New York in September 2019. \n\nThe parties
      reaffirmed their commitment to deepen the countries’ expanded strategic partnership,
      noting the growth in mutual trade and investment. Sultanov also noted significant
      potential for increasing Kazakh exports. At present, 50 items worth approximately
      $1 billion can additionally be delivered to the American market. The agenda
      included interaction issues within mechanisms including the World Trade Organisation
      (WTO) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The

      body: "Kazakhstan is the most efficient and investment-friendly transit hub
        for the greater Eurasia region. By 2020 the country aims to become a key logistics
        hub for Eurasia and beyond by developing transportation and export centers
        on the territory. Kazakhstan and the US have established a robust trade relationship
        that has generated skilled jobs in both countries. Kazakhstan imports annully
        from the U.S. high tech medical equipment, industrial machinery and livestock.

        \n__Proximity to Large Markets and Market Capacity__\n\nKazakhstan is the
        most efficient and investment-friendly transit hub for the greater Eurasia
        region. By 2020 the country aims to become a key logistics hub for Eurasia
        and beyond by developing transportation and export centers on the territory.
        Kazakhstan is setting up the __Western Europe - Western China International
        Transportation Corridor__, which will cut ground transportation time from
        China to Europe in third (from 30 to 10 days) and multiply the transit cargo
        volume by 1,000%, to 170 million tons from the current 16 million tons, allowing
        the country to jump from the 86th spot on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance
        Index to 40th place. This will increase Kazakhstan’s GDP by 68% above a 2010
        baseline while also boosting the GDP of neighboring countries by 43%, providing
        an additional boost to Kazakhstan’s export economy. Kazakhstan’s integration
        into the EEU has already reduced border crossing times and gives Kazakhstan
        access to a wider market of more than 171 million people with $2.7 trillion
        annual GDP.\n\n__Kazakhstan is the Eurasian Hub __\n\nThe continental bridge
        for goods that move from East and West, South to North. By 2020 the country
        aims to become a key transit hub for Eurasia and beyond by developing transportation,
        logistics, and export centers on the territory and neighboring foreign countries.
        Kazakhstan is setting up the Western Europe - Western China International
        Transportation Corridor, which will cut the transportation time from China
        to Europe in third (from 30 to 10 days), will multiply the transit cargo volume
        by 1,000 percent, to 170mil tons from the current 16mil, allowing the country
        to jump from the current 86th spot on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance
        Index to 40th place by increasing cargo transport. This will increase Kazakhstan’s
        GDP by 68 per cent above the 2010 baseline, while boosting the GDP of neighboring
        countries by 43 per cent. Kazakhstan’s integration into the customs union
        with Russia and Belarus, which took full effect in January 2012, has cut border-crossing
        time in half and significantly reduced pilferage. The deeper integration under
        the umbrella of the __Eurasian Economic Union__ (EEU) promises to further
        reduce transportation costs and transaction costs.\n\n<div style=\"display:
        flex; justify-content: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/infographics/nasdaq-aifc.png\"
        style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n\nEEU builds on the successes
        of the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market
        for more than 171 million people with $2.7tn annual GDP. The objective of
        the union is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish
        a common energy market, and enable the free movement of people within the
        community. With the current size of 76.8mil people, the middle class accounts
        for around 30 per cent of total population in Kazakhstan and more than 55
        per cent in Russia. Both are both growing at an annual rate of 7 per cent,
        which makes both of them attractive for importation of consumer goods. Russia
        is the 6th biggest middle class consumer in the world.\n\nFor many investors
        Kazakhstan is a great springboard for expanding not only into the member countries

        title: Eurasian Economic Union
        body: |-
          The Eurasian Economic Union represents the opening of new economic opportunities without sacrificing political independence. The EEU builds on the economic success of the Customs Union, and the EEU is in line with Kazakhstan's multi-vector foreign policy. Kazakhstan unequivocally maintains the EEU will not erode the country's political independence, which is critical to Kazakhstan’s priorities and multi-vector orientation. The EEU in its final form serves to advance Kazakhstan’s economic integration with the European Union, the United States, China and Latin America.

          ### Facts about the EEU:

          - The EEU builds on the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market with the total GDP of $1.9 TN. The Member-States of the Eurasian Economic Union are the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation. The objective of the union is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish a common energy market, and enable the free movement of people within the community.
          - The EEU is an economic, not political union. It will not have any supra-national authority, over the sovereign states. Kazakhstan has made it clear that it will not support any supra-national political bodies, such as an EEU Parliament.
          - No country will dominate the decision-making process in the Union as each country has an equal vote as well as the right to veto. Resolutions will be based on the ruling of the majority.
          - As in the case of the EU, the member countries have various predispositions and concerns reflecting their endowments and power. Kazakh officials favor an economic association (much like UK’s disposition to the EU) while Belarus and Russia support stronger and deeper political and economic union (much like Germany). Given Kazakhstan’s insistence that EEU will not go beyond economic union, it is unlikely that integration will proceed further than the currently agreed-to format.
          - The Union is created to facilitate trade, both inside of the Union and with outside economies – not to act as a barrier to trade.
          - As a result of the creation of a new business environment and conditions for interaction between different businesses, all countries will see structural benefits that manifest themselves in the use of workforce, production and infrastructural cooperation and mutual investments. According to analysts, this will generate up to 25 per cent growth in member states by 2030 (15 years after the creation of the economic space), or around $600bn.

        title: WTO Accession
        body: |-
          Accession to the WTO has been a foreign policy priority for Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991. Kazakhstan gained WTO membership in 2015.  Kazakhstan worked to create the Eurasian Economic Union prior to WTO membership, which is viewed as a practical realization of the Kazakh President’s idea concerning the economic integration of Eurasian countries similar to the European Union announced by him in the mid-1990s.

          It is well known that a unified customs territory is an integral step towards that high level of economic integration. Neither in negotiations on the WTO, nor in negotiations on the Customs Union did Kazakhstan ever renounce its interests, and the country considers both processes to be mutually complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Therefore, the processes of Eurasian integration and WTO accession have always been in parallel.

          __WTO advances Kazakhstan’s Economic Interests__

          Kazakhstan's goal is further strengthening integration among global economies, and facilitate trade and investment freely among WTO countries.  Elimination of internal customs borders and harmonization of legislation of the WTO members is already creating additional benefits for the trading partners by insuring free circulation of goods between the Eurasian countries and thus, providing traders and investors with bigger economic space and more attractive market for potential investors.
          Kazakhstan's Regional Trade Agreements

          Kazakhstan’s decision on creating the EEU with Russia and Belarus was based solely on the country’s own economic interests including the following factors:

          - __Mineral Reserves.__ Kazakhstan has the sixth largest mineral reserves in the world and is a major player in the energy markets. A major portion of mineral and energy resources produced in Kazakhstan is exported to external markets. One of the main tasks of the Government of Kazakhstan is development of nonextractive sectors and diversification of the economy and export promotion of highly marketable products. A unified customs tariff within the Customs Union would expand the regional market and promote Kazakhstan’s exports. Future customs tariff policy within the Customs Union will allow the import of raw materials and equipment under low custom duties within the development of investment projects. Establishment of the Customs Union would entail creation of a unified commodity market with a total GDP of about $2 trillion (2008) and a population of 180 million people, as well as create preferential conditions within the Customs Union. Such a large market within a unified customs territory would make Kazakhstan even more attractive for foreign investors who have considered Kazakhstan as one of the most attractive markets in our part of the world.
          - __Geopolitical Realities.__ Kazakhstan is the largest land-locked country in the world and much of its foreign trade depends on the routes that go through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the Customs Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory) transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading relations, particularly with the European Union, are implemented through the transit of the territory of Russia.
          - __Global Financial Crisis.__ The crisis has thinned down the flow of FDIs, decreased trade turnover, led to the introduction of protectionist mechanisms by some trade partners, and seriously damaged the economies of neighboring states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more active and joint approach to further integrate and modernize the regional economy. Creation of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient use of the limited financial resources due to the global economic crisis. It will also provide a rationale for companies to use available resources to increase their production capacity.

          WTO accession provides sizable benefits for Kazakhstan and serves its long-term economic priorities. The decision was based on the need to meet Kazakhstan’s national economic interests including:

          - Unimpeded access to global markets
          - Expanding trade with large neighboring economies, such as Russia and China
          - Accelerated economic diversification by moving towards service and technology based economy.

          Therefore, any speculations suggesting political motivation behind the decision are baseless.

          __WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel__

          As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

          Kazakhstan’s team reassured American counterparts that the accession to the WTO has always been top priority for Kazakhstan’s foreign policy. The United States welcomes progress achieved by Kazakhstan in bringing its legislation in compliance with the WTO rules and supports its continuous trade liberalization process. In particular, such issues as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property rights and veterinary certificates are at the final stage of negotiations.

          Kazakhstan has finalized negotiations with the Unites States on Goods market access. Minister of Economic Development and Trade Zhanar Aitzhanova signed a document with U.S. Representative to the WTO Michael Punke in Geneva.

        title: Astana International Finance Centre
        body: |-
          Kazakhstan enters a new phase of the development after a period of high economic growth. The crisis of 2007-2009 was successfully overcome through the use of accumulated resources. Sovereign wealth funds, established in the previous years, played a major role in the economic development. With the falling prices for the country's main export commodities, new approaches to public policy are necessary. In particular, diversification of economy, better management of the accumulated funds and assets, as well as the development of a financial services market have become important. At the same time, the country's integration into regional cooperation organisations and the Eurasian Economic Union creates conditions for accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan into the global financial system. 

          Five institutional reforms of the Head of State and Hundred Concrete Steps Program to implement these reforms (hereinafter – Plan of the Nation) have become a new starting point in the development of Kazakhstan. As part of the Plan of the Nation, [Astana International Financial Centre](http://www.aifc.kz/) (hereinafter – AIFC) was established at the order of the President of Republic of Kazakhstan with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition (hereinafter – EXPO-2017) infrastructure. 

          A Constitutional Law providing favourable environment for the AIFC participants was passed for a successful launch of the AIFC. The main goal of AIFC, like of any other state reform, is to improve welfare of Kazakhstan residents. Various aspects of the AIFC shall allow improving the approaches to managing sovereign wealth funds and facilitating the transfer of foreign knowledge and technology to the country, thus, ensuring an increase and the development of human capital. The slowdown of business cycles in the country due to the deteriorating conditions in foreign markets and unfavourable geopolitical situation in the region, only justifies the need for a financial centre - it is important now more than ever to attract new investments in the financial capital, as well as in technology and human capital. The initiative to establish an international financial centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development. 

          In order to establish AIFC as a local centre of expertise with a developed capital market and later to develop it into a regional platform for financial intermediation, the strategy for the development of AIFC has been developed until 2021, inclusive. Implementing the initial phase of the development of the AIFC shall serve as a solid foundation for the realisation of the subsequent phases, namely, development into a regional financial centre, and eventually, into an international financial centre. The strategy for the development of AIFC shall be reviewed upon the implementation of each phase of the development due to a change of goals and objectives.

      title: Energy Partnership
      body: "The United States pays great attention to energy cooperation and has
        supported Kazakhstan in its efforts to increase its role in ensuring global
        energy security. __The Energy Partnership Commission__ that was established
        in 2003, plays an important role in coordinating energy cooperation between
        the countries. \n\nIn 2017, the United States and Kazakhstan elevated their
        bilateral energy partnership to the level of the __Strategic Energy Dialogue__.
        This expanded format provides the basis for cooperation in the development
        of peaceful nuclear industry, technologies for carbon capture, storage and
        utilization, stability of energy networks, as well as nuclear safety and non-proliferation.\n\nIn
        January 2018, President Nursultan Nazarbayev met with US Energy Secretary Rick
        Perry and State Agency for Foreign Private Investment President Ray Washburn
        during his official visit to the US. The sides discussed Kazakhstan-US cooperation
        in the oil and gas sector and spoke about the implementation of projects at
        the Tengiz and Kashagan oilfields. President Nazarbayev also told Secretary
        Perry about the opening of the __Low-Enriched Uranium Bank__ in Kazakhstan.\n\nAt
        the 10th Annual Meeting of the Commission in 2014 the countries agreed to
        continue promoting cooperation in four broad areas- nuclear security, hydrocarbon
        resources, renewable energy and energy efficiency, and electric power. In
        the context of Kazakhstan’s plan to transition towards Green Economy, the
        countries have established a permanent expert dialogue and advanced implementation
        of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean energy projects. \n\nThe
        US has actively promoted diversification of pipeline export-routes in the
        Caspian Sea region, in order to increase the energy security of consumers
        in Europe and the Middle East and to diversify the market opportunities for
        Kazakhstani exporters. With American support, Kazakhstan signed an agreement
        with Azerbaijan in June 2006 to transport oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
        (BTC) pipeline. For Kazakhstan, this agreement was necessary to safeguard
        its export markets due to Russia’s refusal to increase the transportation
        capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and the BTC’s capacity to
        handle increased production. \n\nSince 2006 Kazakhstan has been co-funding
        programs under USAID’s Economic Development Program jointly with USAID, demonstrating
        country’s interest in USAID’s expertise and support in developing small and
        medium enterprises, economic reforms, and regional trade. For the year 2014,
        programs targeting development of small businesses, foreign investment attraction
        and energy efficiency increase were allocated around $4.1 million. Kazakhstan
        received approximately $2 billion of all-agency funding from the US between
        1993 and 2012.\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev met with US Energy Secretary Rick
        Perry and State Agency for Foreign Private Investment President Ray Washburn
        on January 16, 2018 during his official visit to the US. The sides discussed
        Kazakhstan-US cooperation in the oil and gas sector and spoke about the implementation
        of projects at the Tengiz and Kashagan oilfields. President Nazarbayev also
        told Perry about the opening of the __Low-Enriched Uranium Bank__ in Kazakhstan."

        trudged has since 1991 worn well-trodden for other foreign investors, large
        companies, small- and medium- sized enterprises, and even startups. More than
        700 American companies are successfully operating in Kazakhstan, including
        Chevron, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Halliburton, etc.\n\nAnnual business
        and investment events are held between the two countries to promote economic

            value: U.S. companies were among the very first to do business in a newly
              independent Kazakhstan. The path these early American multinationals
              and investors first trudged has since 1991 worn well-trodden for other
              foreign investors, large companies, small- and medium- sized enterprises,
              and even startups. More than 700 American companies are successfully
              operating in Kazakhstan, including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, General Electric,
              Halliburton, etc.

      title: Peacekeeping Operations
      body: |-
        Kazakhstan has assumed a critical leadership role in supporting US operations in fighting the common threats to security and stability in the region. In 2003, Kazakhstan sent military engineers to assist operations of the U.S. coalition in Iraq. Over five years, nine contingents totaling 290 Kazakh peacekeeping troops were rotated through Iraq. The troops carried out various missions, including humanitarian assistance operations, convoy security, perimeter and base defense, quick reaction force duties, traffic control point operations, water purification, and demining. In fact, Kazakhstan's forces dismantled nearly five million mines and explosives during their tenure in the Iraq. Kazakh doctors, together with their Iraqi colleagues and counterparts from other countries, provided medical assistance to more than 500 Iraqis, as well.

        Kazakhstan hosts annual Steppe Eagle joint counter-terrorism and peacekeeping exercises between Kazakh, US and NATO forces. Steppe Eagle drills have been held in Kazakhstan every year except 2014 and 2018 since 2003. The 2018 exercises were held at McCrady Army National Guard Training Centre in South Carolina.

        After the completion of the Steppe Eagle 2018 exercises, Kazakhstan sent 120 peacekeepers to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in October 2018. The Kazakh soldiers were deployed in the Eastern part of the country along the border of Lebanon with Israel and Syria.

Thanks to these exercises and the military training assistance Kazakhstan receives, it has developed forces that are capable of working with NATO as well as protect pipelines and other sensitive energy infrastructures of the country from potential attacks. Moreover, the US helped Kazakhstan strengthen its naval capabilities. These efforts confirm Kazakhstani government’s commitment to establish strong defense and security ties with the Western Allies.

      extreme continental climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan
      hosted the 2017 world's fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana Expo
      2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s favourable location in the centre
      of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically advantageous transport, communication
      and logistics centre, and a natural bridge between Europe and Asia.\n\n<iframe

      picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe transfer of the capital
      to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
      high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
      in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for 10
      percent, while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2 percent.\n\nThe
      city has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan. \n\nEntrepreneurship
      is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are more than 128,000 small
      and medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan is among the leading cities
      of the country in terms of the volume of construction. After the city became
      the capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres of housing facilities have
      been built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan and abroad took part in the
      construction of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural concept of Nur-Sultan was based
      on the idea of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying a special Eurasian style of Nur-Sultan
      should harmoniously combine the cultural traditions of both the East and the
      West. A well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa became the author of the
      general layout of the capital city.\n\nToday Nur-Sultan, located in the heart
      of Eurasia, is a venue for numerous international forums, congresses and large
      scale international events. The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional
      Religions, the Astana Economic Forum and other forums are held regularly in
      the city. In December, 2010, the historical Summit of the Organisation for Security
      and Co-operation in Europe took place in the capital city of Kazakhstan, after
      which it hosted the anniversary summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
      and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. In early 2011, the city welcomed the
      participants and guests of the 7th Asian Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted
      the international specialized exhibition EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military
      district was founded in 1832 on the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel
      woods. Until 1961, the name of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and
      because of its ideal location, it soon turned into a central point for trade
      livestock fairs. In 1961, the name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola
      in 1992. Astana was not the official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital was
      renamed to Nur-Sultan after the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n###
      Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s area was over 300
      sq. km., but today, the city boundaries are rapidly expanding.\n- The distance
      between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the former capital, is 1,318 km.\n- In 1998,
      Nur-Sultan’s population was about 300,000. This year (2009), the population
      has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn 1997, the President of Kazakhstan made
      the decision to relocate the capital of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Akmola city
      (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n- Advantageous geopolitical location\n-
      Considerable industrial potential\n- Crucial resources for subsequent development
      of the construction industry\n- Location in the largest transport junction\n-
      Essential transport and telecommunication infrastructure\n- Highly skilled urban
      workforce\n- Large private sector\n- Potentialities for entrepreneurship development\n-
      Political and social stability\n- Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe
      most important reason for moving the capital and expanding and improving the
      city of Nur-Sultan was to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically
      stable and prosperous, democratically viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt
      Nur-Sultan’s historical inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From
      now on any major decisions important for the future of the people will be made
      here in the centre of this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland
      is beating here. Kazakhstan is making and defining its history and destiny here
      and today.”\n\nIn 1998, the decision was made to officially change the name
      of the new capital Akmola to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year later, the
      Astana from waterUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
      (UNESCO) granted the status, “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe city’s rapid
      growth as the administrative and business center of the country matches the
      original concept for social and economic development. The theme of this concept
      is “The blossoming of Astana is the blossoming of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More than
      200 joint ventures and foreign companies are operating in the capital, including
      those belonging to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Kyrgyzstan\n- Switzerland.\n \nAstana
      is a member of the International Association of Capitals and Cultural Cities
      of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); it also has close bilateral
      relations with 13 cities and regions of the CIS.\n\n__The growth of Astana,
      as a result of it becoming the new capital, has had a powerful influence on
      neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n- Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n- East
      Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also supported the development of entrepreneurship
      and businesses which will, in turn, lead to the opening of foreign companies,
      firms, and major bank branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business Magnet__\n\nAstana
      is a major center of activity and the hub of national and international transport
      links. The extensive traffic is mainly due to strong economic ties between:\n\n-
      South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The Volga
      region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government have
      spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and 2004, the
      number of new legal entities registered in the capital more than doubled, and
      the local housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers of the capital
      city’s economic activity are:__\n\n- Construction\n- The food industry\n- Tourism\n\nThe
      city boasts a growing number of restaurants and hotels that cater to business
      travelers. Major exhibition centers and universities, such as the L. Gumilyov
      Eurasian University, can be found within Astana. The A. Barayev Research Institute
      of Grain Farming is another establishment, not only famous in Kazakhstan but
      within the scientific world. In addition to the three museums, Astana also has
      branches of the Union of Writers and Artists of Kazakhstan, with over 40 newspapers
      and two literary magazines being published in the city.\n\n__Tourist Attractions__\n\n__Astana’s
      tourist attractions include:__\n\n- Astana-Baiterek, a monument to the country’s
      independence with a sweeping view of the city\n- A circus\n- An ethnic park\n-
      A presidential culture museum\n- The world’s most inland aquarium\n- A 10,000-seat
      skating stadium and cycle track.\n\nAdditionally, Astana is fast becoming a
      mecca for sports tourism; new sport centers are planned for the neighboring
      areas of Korgalzhyn and Ereimentau.\n\n__Culture and the Arts__\n\nThe Presidential
      Cultural Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established in the center
      of Astana. The structure of the Center includes a museum Cultural Centerwith
      various rooms and displays representing Kazakhstan’s past and present values.
      In addition, the Center has a library containing more than a million books and
      electronic catalogues.\n\nThe Kazakh National Music Academy has also been established
      in Astana. This Academy combines specialized and general musical education into
      one school. The Academy is a member of the European Association of Conservatories,
      Academies and Musical High Schools.\n\n__Spectators enjoy visiting theaters
      such as:__\n\n- The Theater of Drama and Music, named after K. Kuanyshbaev and

      M. Gorky\n- The National Opera and Ballet Theater, named after K Baiseitova
      and opened in Cinema City2000.\n\nIn addition to theaters, the pristine new
      cinema complex, Cinema-City, was opened in 2000. It was built in the tradition
      of international cinemas and has become a favorite of the people of Astana.\n\n__Eighth
      Wonder of the World__\n\nIn September 2006, the inauguration of the Palace of
      Peace and Accord (62 meters in height), also known as the Peace Pyramid, marked
      another milestone in Astana’s evolution and may well become the Eighth Wonder
      of the World. Built to house the Assembly of Nations of Kazakhstan, a university,
      a museum, a library and a winter garden, the pyramid was designed by British
      architect Sir Norman Foster, who is famous for his futuristic glass roof on
      the German Parliament, the Reichstag.\n\n__Special Economic Zone__\n\nConstruction
      of the new city developments on left bank of the Esil River has started. To
      aid in this process, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ), providing more favorable
      conditions for investment, has been created. According to the General Development
      Plan of the Capital, the integrated structure of this complex, located on the
      left bank, will symbolize the new capital.\n\n__The creation of the SEZ will
      provide many benefits to both the state and potential investors, including:__\n\n-
      State support of direct investments into construction of Astana city\n- Significant
      tax privileges and preferentials\n- Opportunities to introduce modern technologies
      and scientific achievements in the field of construction\n- Land for construction
      in the new center of the capital\n- Formation and development of the real estate
      market\n- Guaranteed right to prolong the investment activity on the initial
      terms, until the expiration of the SEZ period. This cannot exceed ten years,
      irrespective of the changes in the juridical regime of the SEZ or its liquidation
      before the appointed time, including the extension of the area. \n\nThe Customs
      regulation in the territory of the SEZ is applied in accordance to the customs
      legislature of Republic of Kazakhstan. The territory of the SEZ is considered
      to be a part of the customs-free territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n__The

          value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its territory
            is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape is far from
            uniform, as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains, and river valleys.
            In the North is found the Kokshetau summit; in the southern and south-eastern
            portions of the region is the Saryarka, part of the Kazakh topography;
            and plains compose the North-East.

      is deemed to be your acceptance of the modified Website Terms of Use.\n\n \n\n "

    title: Privacy Policy
    body: "This notice provides the Embassy of Kazakhstan in the United States (the
      Embassy) privacy policy regarding the nature, purpose, use, and sharing of any
      Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collected via this website. Our privacy
      policy explains our information practices when you provide PII to us, whether
      collected online or offline, or when you visit us online to browse, obtain information,
      or conduct a transaction. PII may include: your name, email, mailing and/or
      home address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally.
      We do not require you to register or provide personal information to visit our
      website.\n\nThe PII you provide on the Embassy website will be used only for
      its intended purpose. We will protect your information consistent with the principles
      of the Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002, and the Federal Records
      Act.\n\n__Personally Identifiable Information__\n\nAs a general rule, the Embassy
      does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose
      to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary.
      By doing so, you are giving the Embassy your permission to use the information
      for the stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may result
      in the Embassy’s inability to provide you with the service you desire.\n\nIf
      you choose to provide us with PII on a Embassy website, through such methods
      as completing a web form or sending us an email, we will use that information
      to help us provide you the information or service you have requested or to respond
      to your message. The information we may receive from you varies based on what
      you do when visiting our site.\n\n \n\nGenerally, the information requested
      by the Embassy will be used to respond to your inquiry or to provide you with
      the service you request. When this information is requested, the reasons for
      collecting it, a description of the Embassy’s intended use of the information,
      how to grant consent to use mandatorily provided information, and how to grant
      consent for other than statutorily mandated uses will be fully described in
      a separate customized “Privacy Notice.” This customized Privacy Notice will
      either appear on the web page collecting the information or be accessible through
      a hyperlink (link) prominently displayed immediately above or below the information
      request.\n\n \n\nEmail\n\n \n\nMany of our programs and websites allow you to
      send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to your
      inquiry. We will only send you general information via email. You should be
      reminded that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore,
      we suggest that you do not send sensitive personal data (such as your Social
      Security number) to us via email. If your intended email communication is very
      sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, credit card, or
      Social Security number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail. Another alternative
      may be submission of data through a secure web page, if available.\n\n \n\nElectronic
      mail messages that meet the definition of records in the Federal Records Act
      (44 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) are covered under the same disposition schedule as
      all other Federal records. This means that emails you send us will be preserved
      and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition
      of Federal records. Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when
      no longer needed.\n\n \n\nCategories of information the Embassy collects on
      its websites are further described below.\n\n \n\nAutomatically Collected Information\n\n
      \n\nWe collect and temporarily store certain information about your visit for
      use in site management and security purposes only. We collect and analyze this
      information because it helps us to better design our website to suit your needs.
      We may also automatically collect information about the web content you view
      in the event of a known security or virus threat. This information includes:\n\n
      \n\n1. The Internet domain from which you access our website (for example, “xcompany.com”
      if you use a private Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect
      from an educational domain);\n\n \n\n2. The Internet Protocol (IP) address (a
      unique number for each computer connected to the Internet) from which you access
      our website;\n\n \n\n3. The type of browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer,
      Chrome) used to access our site;\n\n \n\n4. The operating system (e.g., Windows,
      Mac OS, Unix) used to access our site;\n\n \n\n5. The date and time you access
      our site;\n\n \n\n6. The Universal Resource Locators (URLs), or addresses, of
      the pages you visit;\n\n \n\n7. Your username, if it was used to log in to the
      website; and\n\n \n\n8. If you visited this website from another website, the
      URL of the forwarding site.\n\n \n\nWe may share the above information with
      our employees or representatives with a “need-to-know” in the performance of
      their official duties, other Federal agencies, or other named representatives
      as needed to quickly process your request or transaction. This information is
      only used to help us make our site more useful for you. Raw data logs are retained
      temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only. More
      information about how we share information can be found in our Privacy Act Systems
      of Records Notices.\n\n \n\nThird-Party Websites and Applications\n\n \n\nThe
      Embassy uses social media websites and other kinds of third-party websites.
      The Embassy uses social media websites to interact with foreign constituencies
      and engage in public diplomacy worldwide. Social media websites are used to
      publicize embassy and Embassy events, and engage with members of the public
      in foreign countries. The Embassy also uses web measurement and customization
      technologies to measure the number of visitors to our websites and their various
      sections and to help make our websites more useful to visitors. In such cases,
      the third-party application may request an email address, username, password,
      and geographic location (e.g., State, region, or ZIP code) for account registration
      purposes. The Embassy of State does not use third-party websites to solicit
      and collect PII from individuals. Any PII passively collected (i.e., not solicited)
      by the third-party website will not be transmitted or stored by the Embassy;
      no PII will be disclosed, sold or transferred to any other entity outside the
      Embassy, unless required for law enforcement purposes or by statute.\n\n \n\nThe
      Embassy uses various types of online surveys to collect opinions and feedback
      from a random sample of visitors. Primarily, kazakhembus.com uses the ForeSee
      Results’ American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey on an ongoing
      basis to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with the kazakhembus.com
      website. This survey does not collect PII. Although the survey invitation pops
      up for a random sample of visitors, it is optional. If you decline the survey,
      you will still have access to the identical information and resources at the
      kazakhembus.com site as those who do take the survey. The survey reports are
      available only to kazakhembus.com managers and other designated staff who require
      this information to perform their duties. The Embassy may use other limited-time
      surveys for specific purposes, which are explained at the time they are posted.\n\nThe
      Embassy retains the data from the ACSI survey results as long as needed to support
      the mission of the kazakhembus.com website.\n\nInformation Collected for Tracking
      and Customization (Cookies)\n\nA cookie is a small file that a website transfers
      to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session
      while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the
      cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it.
      There are two types of cookies:\n\n \n\nSession: Session cookies last only as
      long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie is
      deleted. Websites may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to
      enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your
      preferences for interacting with the site.\nPersistent: Persistent cookies are
      saved on a user’s hard drive in order to determine which users are new to the
      site or are returning, and for repeat visitors, to block recurring invitations
      to take the ForeSee satisfaction survey.\n \n\nIf you do not wish to have session
      or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn cookies off in your
      browser. You will still have access to all information and resources at Embassy
      websites. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some Embassy
      websites. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie
      usage at all other websites you visit as well.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe Embassy takes
      the security of all PII very seriously. We take precautions to maintain the
      security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this
      site. Such measures include access controls designed to limit access to the
      information to the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ
      various security technologies to protect the information stored on our systems.
      We routinely test our security measures to ensure that they remain operational
      and effective.\n\nWe take the following steps to secure the information we collect:\n\nEmploy
      internal access controls to ensure that only personnel who have access to your
      information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.\nTrain
      appropriate personnel on our privacy and security policies and compliance requirements.\nSecure
      the areas where we retain paper copies of the information we collect online.\nPerform
      regular backups of the information we collect online to ensure against loss.\nUse
      technical controls to secure the information we collect online including, but
      not limited to:\nSecure Socket Layer (SSL)\nEncryption\nFirewalls\nPassword
      protections\nPeriodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and
      technical compliance.\nEmploy external access safeguards to identify and prevent
      unauthorized access by outsiders that attempt to “hack” into, or cause harm
      to, the information contained in our systems.\n \n\nWe hold our contractors
      and other third-party providers to the same high standards that we use to ensure
      the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information they may
      have access to in the course of their work completed on behalf of the Embassy.\n\nInteraction
      With Children Online\n\nThe Embassy is committed to the protection of children’s
      online privacy. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs
      information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable
      consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using,
      or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. If a Embassy website
      intends to collect information about children under 13 years old, COPPA-required
      information and instructions will be provided by the specific web page that
      collects information about the child. The web page will specify exactly what
      the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.\n\nVisiting
      Other Websites\n\nOur website contains links to international agencies, private
      organizations, and some commercial entities. These websites are not within our
      control and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices.
      Once you link to another site, you are subject to the policies of that site.
      All Federal websites, however, are subject to the same Federal policy, security,
      and accessibility mandates.\n\n \n\n \n\n "

  title: Welcome remarks from Zhanibek Abdrashov, Consul General of Kazakhstan
  body: "Dear Friends,\n\nWelcome to the website for the Consulate of Kazakhstan in
    New York City. \n\nKazakhstan is a facinating and enchanting country. Kazakh statehood
    dates back more than 550 years, and Kazakhs were active traders on the ancient
    silk road that passed goods and ideas between the East and the West. As a result,
    Kazakh culture has touched aspects of modern civilization in subtle ways. \n\nToday,
    Kazakhstan is the 9th largest country by land mass in the world, which is the
    size of Eastern Europe and four times the size of the state of Texas (in fact,
    the city of Shymkent in the South of Kazakhstan is [nicknamed Texas](https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/greetings-from-the-texas-of-kazakhstan/)!).
    \ Kazakhstan is a modern melting pot: more than 140 ethnic groups call Kazakhstan
    home, and dozens of religions are practiced openly. \n\nThis website is your resource
    for the information whether you have visited Kazakhstan before, are planning your
    first visit, just want to learn more about Kazakhstan, or are a Kazakh citizen
    living in the United States.\n\nHere is a quick overview of what you'll find on
    our site.\n\nTravel to Kazakhstan within the last few years has become much easier
    for American citizens. Several years ago Kazakhstan [established a visa-free regime](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/world/asia/kazakhstan-visa-free-travel.html?_r=0)
    for citizens of several countries, including the United States. Americans planning
    to spend fewer than 15 (fifteen) days in Kazakhstan do not require a visa to enter.
    A valid passport is required, of course. A visa is required for Americans planning
    to stay more than 15 days in Kazakhstan. The kind of visa required will depend
    on the nature of the stay, and the visa section of this website will have information
    that you need.\n\nFor those who want to learn more about Kazakhstan, our Discover
    Kazakhstan section is full of information about Kazakh history, culture, food,
    literature and tourism. We also encourage you to follow the [#VisitKazakhstan](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23VisitKazakhstan)
    hashtag on Twitter for great Kazakhstan travel and tourism ideas. \n\nIf you're
    a student or person interested in the domestic and foreign policies of Kazakhstan,
    you'll find thorough information and resources in the Kazakh-U.S. Relations, Foreign
    Policy and Economy & Business sections. The Media Center is a centralized location
    for all the lastest news, featured articles, video and photos that we post to
    the website.\n\nWe are grateful to the American families who adopt children born
    in Kazakhstan. Information about adoption is available in the Adoption section.
    \n\nIf you don't find what you're looking for on this website, the consulate staff
    is more than happy to help you. \n\nThank you for your interest in Kazakhstan
    and I hope you stay in close touch with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ConsulateKazakhstanNYC/)
    and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Con_Gen_Kz_NYC).\n\nWarm Regards, \n\n__Zhanibek
    Abdrashov, Consul General of Kazakhstan__"

      body: "Dear friends, \nIt is a pleasure to welcome you at the homepage of the
        Consulate General of the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York. \n\nSince its
        independence, Kazakhstan has built a strong and multifaceted relationship
        with the United States. Over the past years, our country has become a credible
        partner of the United States in all strategically important spheres from the
        defense, security, and non-proliferation to trade, investment, and human development.
        \n\nThe longstanding relations between the two countries have allowed us to
        advance a common agenda and opportunities for cooperation across the full
        range of bilateral and regional issues.\n\nI look forward to expanding our
        political and economic relations further into the realm of economics, investment,
        and other forms of cooperation. \nThank you for visiting our website. Should
        you feel that you need more information, the Consulate staff is happy to help
        you. \n\nPlease follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nSincerely,\nAlmat
        Aidarbekov\nConsul General of the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York \n\n\n\n\n\t"

    __By Ambassador Kazykhanov__

    Earlier this year, Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev made an official visit to Washington, DC, where he met with President Donald Trump and some of America’s top business executives. The goal of the visit was straightforward: To strengthen commercial and trade ties between the United States and Kazakhstan in order to create jobs and accelerate economic growth in both countries.

    The two leaders cemented the visit with the signing of the Enhanced Strategic Partnership, an agreement for the two nations to continue seeking opportunities for collaboration in multiple areas, including trade and investment.

    While the Trump administration pushes an economic agenda, the government of Kazakhstan has also laid out an ambitious plan to transform the country into the largest business and transit hub in Central Asia. Under this vision, Kazakhstan would become the bridge between Europe and Asia, the Middle East and the West — a central point for global economic integration and investment destination.

    For Kazakhstan, our relationship with the United States is essential to achieving these goals of modernization. American business leaders understand the large role that Kazakhstan’s economy plays in Central Asia and how it is the most market-oriented economy in the region. Today, Kazakhstan accounts for 80 percent of all foreign direct investment in Central Asia, and it aims to join the ranks of the top 30 global economies by 2050.

    Investing in our region is a solid venture not only for the Kazakh people, but it also generates jobs in the United States, which is why we are collaborating with the Council on Foreign Relations and Kazakh Invest — Kazakhstan’s inward investment group — to host a major investment conference in New York City this week titled, “Kazakhstan in a changing Eurasia.”

    Attending the conference will be representatives from more than 200 American companies, along with a multitude of Kazakh business leaders and high-level ministers, including Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister, Minister of Economy and Deputy Prime Minister.

    To further demonstrate our commitment to stronger commercial ties with the United States, we have recently been instituting a new wave of structural reforms to transform our country into a regional financial powerhouse. These reforms aim to offset our oil dependence with a growing services sector while also increasing transport hub capacities and financial intermediation — improving our business climate for outside investors.

    One great example of a recent Kazakh-American joint venture is the launch of the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) in collaboration with American partners like Nasdaq. Our government is devoting more than $60 million per year to develop the center through 2020, while AIFC aims to attract up to $40 billion in global investments by 2025. We believe that American companies can and should play a major role in AIFC’s development, as it is the first major financial center throughout Central Asia.

    In the spirit of the Enhanced Strategic Partnership, the Kazakh delegation in New York this week is forging new relationships and enhancing existing partnerships with members of the American business community. The investment conference hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations aims to showcase that Kazakhstan is serious about welcoming American companies to our country.

    We have deep trust in our relationship with the United States and in the American economy, and we hope that American business leaders will come to understand the true value of everything Kazakhstan has to offer.

  - Ambassador's Opinion
  body: "The discovery of the energy of atom fission was a fruit of human genius.
    But using this discovery for military purposes is the result of artful carelessness
    of people. We have a chance to correct this mistake of the 20th century…Renunciation
    of war and nuclear weapons would be an act of supreme wisdom of humanity in the
    21st century.\n\nAs the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly convened
    on  September 19, 2017, in New York to address issues with worldwide implications,
    significant attention was paid to nuclear nonproliferation and the threat that
    possession of  nuclear weapons presents to the security of the entire interna­tional
    community.\n\nAddressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Rex W.
    Tillerson con­veyed a comprehensive vision of reducing the threats emanating from
    weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFirst and foremost, Secretary Tillerson outlined
    the importance of highlighting the positive trajectories of nations that have
    voluntarily renounced their nuclear weapons.\n\nIn this context, he said, “Kazakhstan
    is a particularly illustrative example of the wisdom of relinquishing nuclear
    weapons. In partnership with the United States, and aided by the Cooperative Threat
    Reduction Act spearheaded by U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, Kazakhstan
    opted to remove from its territory former Soviet weapons and related nuclear technologies,
    and [it] joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-weapons state.”\n\nThis
    courageous decision by the leaders of Kazakhstan greatly reduced the prospect
    of nuclear weapons, components of nuclear weapons or nuclear materials and dual-use
    technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Nuclear weapons introduced complexity
    into relations with other countries, and they introduced the risk of miscalculation,
    accident or escalation. Kazakhstan’s actions represented a key step in that country’s
    becoming part of the community of nations.\n\nAs a result of Kazakhstan’s letting
    go of nuclear weapons, the world does not look on Kazakhstan as a potential nuclear
    aggressor or a rogue state. It did not make enemies of its nuclear neighbors,
    Russia or China. Today Kazakhstan has overwhelmingly been at peace with its neighbors,
    and its trade relations are robust. This year, it hosted World Expo 2017, an event
    in Astana that showcased the sources of future energy and investment opportunities
    in Kazakhstan to attendees from around the world.\n\nThis demonstrates that Kazakhstan
    is a modern nation making a substantial contribution to regional and international
    peace and prosperity. Kazakhstan has only benefitted from its early decision.
    In my previous career, I met President Nursultan Nazarbayev, the founding president
    of Kazakhstan, on many occasions and had the opportunity to ask him about this
    decision. He is more at peace with his choice than ever. He once remarked to me,
    “It was the best thing I ever did for our young country.”\n\nIndeed, the international
    community is well aware of the fact that one of the legacies of the former Soviet
    Union’s policy strategy in the aftermath of World War II and as a result of the
    Cold War arms race was building the new nuclear-weapons complex on Kazakhstan
    soil. The USSR leadership sought to use the country’s central geographical location
    to deploy Soviet nuclear missiles in a way that would reach even the most remote
    parts of the world and lead to the most devastating outcomes in affected areas.\n\nAs
    the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the newly independent Kazakhstan overnight
    emerged as the fourth-largest nuclear power in the world. Having inherited the
    major Soviet nuclear testing site at Semipalatinsk and some of the largest nuclear
    weapons, including 104 SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 40 Tu-95
    strategic bombers with air-launched cruise missiles—comprising approximately 1,410
    nuclear warheads in total—the young country could pose a serious threat to the
    international community.\n\nBut it did not pursue this destructive path. Instead,
    as a firm believer in confidence-building measures, dialogue and partnership,
    Nazarbayev laid down a comprehensive long-term strategy aimed at complete dismantle­ment
    and removal of one of the world’s most pivotal nuclear arsenals and establishment
    of his nation as a reliable partner globally.\n\nOn August 29, 1991, President
    Nazarbayev signed a decree to close the Semipalatinsk test range, making Kazakhstan
    the first nation in history to shut down its nuclear testing site. The decree
    also prohibited further nuclear weapons testing on Kazakhstan’s territory. The
    shutdown of the Semipalatinsk Test Site sent an important message to the international
    community, and its spillover effect paved the way for closing the world’s other
    major testing sites in Nevada, Novaya Zemlya, Lop Nur and Moruroa.\n\nOne of the
    most significant steps in the country’s nonproliferation efforts occurred in 1994,
    when a joint Kazakhstan-United States operation named Project Sapphire transferred
    to the United States approximately 600 kilograms of weapons-grade, highly enriched
    uranium from the Ulba Metallurgical Plant. As a result of this joint exercise,
    in 2001 Kazakhstan removed about 2,900 kilograms of nuclear fuel from the Mangyshlak
    Atomic Energy Combine in Aktau, where it was down-blended into forms of uranium
    suitable for use in commercial and scientific purposes.\n\nIn December 1994, Kazakhstan
    signed the Treaty on The Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear
    state. In return for Kazakhstan’s renouncing of its nuclear arsenal, the United
    States, the United Kingdom and Russia have provided the country with formal security
    guarantees, thereby contributing to peaceful development and unlocking the economic
    potential of the newly independent country.\n\nLeading by example, during the
    next two-and-a-half decades of its devoted campaign, Kazakhstan became a global
    advocate of arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. At Kazakhstan’s initiative,
    the United Nations General Assembly has recog­nized August 29, the day on which
    Kazakhstan shut down the Semipalatinsk testing ground, as the official International
    Day against Nuclear Tests.\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of the Semipalatinsk site’s
    closing, in 2011, the nation’s capital Astana hosted an International Forum for
    a Nuclear-Weapons-Free-World that led, a year later, to even broader engagement,
    representation and support, including two hundred participants from 75 countries,
    the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the international
    conference “From a Nuclear Test Ban to a Nuclear Weapons-Free World.” \n\nA few
    years later, Kazakhstan’s anti-nuclear diplomacy took another significant step
    by bringing into force the Central Asian Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone Agreement (CANWFZ),
    which plays a pivotal role in contributing to global peace and stability. The
    CANWFZ is the world’s fifth nuclear-weapons-free zone and obliges all signatory
    parties not to research, develop, stockpile or otherwise try to obtain any nuclear
    explosive devices, as well as obliging them to avoid assisting other countries
    from undertaking such activities in the regions covered by the zone. Another important
    feature of CANWFZ is that it covers a vast territory and is the first NWFZ to
    be solely in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to providing a legal framework
    for promoting a nuclear-free regime, Kazakhstan in recent years has devoted paramount
    attention to the realization of its international commitments in this area. As
    interest in nuclear energy grows, the world risks the spread of enrichment technology
    that can be used for nuclear weapons. To address these challenges, Kazakhstan
    has been working closely with the international community to develop an internationally
    ensured supply of low-enriched uranium and creating an option for countries choosing
    not to develop uranium enrichment capabilities.\n\nOne of the most significant
    practical implications of Kazakhstan’s orchestrated efforts has been the establishment
    on its territory of a new $150 million facility—a reserve bank for low-enriched
    uranium (LEU) to discourage new countries from enriching nuclear fuel—under the
    aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency and with the valuable support
    of the United States, the European Union, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Norway
    and the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n\nThe LEU Bank was launched this year on August
    29 to mark the 25th anniversary since Kazakhstan’s leadership made that strategic
    decision to renounce its nuclear arsenal. The purposely built, secure and safe
    facility is based in the eastern part of Kazakhstan, in the city of Oskemen. It
    is designed to store up to 90 tons of the fuel, which is sufficient to power a
    large city for as long as three years and sell it to IAEA members in such cases
    when they are not able to purchase it anywhere else.\n\nAs the IAEA Director General
    noted at the inauguration of the facility in August, “The LEU Bank will serve
    as a last-resort mechanism to provide confidence to countries that they will be
    able to obtain LEU for the manufacture of fuel for nuclear power plants in the
    event of unforeseen, non-commercial disruption to their supplies. I am confident
    that the IAEA LEU Bank will make a valuable contribution to international efforts.”
    The project was also described by the U.S.-based Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI)
    as the “first of its kind not to be under control of any individual country.”\n\nIndeed,
    the LEU Bank encourages countries investing in nuclear power for peaceful purposes
    to refrain from unnecessary high costs of building their own enrichment facilities
    and global proliferation risks. As noted by former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, NTI
    co-founder, “The launching of the IAEA LEU Bank is a major milestone for global
    security and nonproliferation efforts. The Bank will play an important role in
    reducing nuclear danger and serve as a vivid example of the benefits of international
    cooperation at a time when our world is in a race between cooperation and catastrophe.”\n\nWidely
    praised for these efforts and its exemplary role in building a nuclear-safe world,
    Kazakhstan will not cease to work closely with the international community and
    all actors involved to put forward these crucial ideas. In fact, nuclear security
    will remain on the top of the country’s agenda during its 2017-2018 membership
    at the United Nations Security Council."

  body: |-
    Kazakhstan's quarter century of bilateral relations with the United States has been positive and productive, forging a partnership that is making a difference across a range of issues. In this new era, Kazakhstan and the United States are working together to support mutual interests and address global challenges that face both our nations. At the same time, Kazakhstan has the capacity to do more. Its potential has not been fully realized, and nor should it be lost.n early 1853, the United States for the first time hosted the Expo World Fair in New York City. Continuing the success of London's World Fair of 1852, the New York Fair showcased to the world new industrial achievements and demonstrated national pride of a relatively young nation of Americans. This fair was symbolized by the construction of all-glass-and-steel Crystal Palace.

    It is fitting that Kazakhstan, which is an old civilization but a new country, will host Expo 2017 this summer in its new capital, Astana, holding the same lofty expectations that the United States held as a young nation. The theme "Future Energy" is as important and relevant as any expo theme and we expect more than 5 million visitors from 115 countries, including the United States, to participate. Expo 2017 is a significant opportunity for the United States and one that should not be missed.

    It is also a big moment for the region. For the first time such a large international event will be held in Central Asia. Kazakhstan's goal is for Expo to showcase the latest knowledge and development in traditional, clean, and alternative energy from across the world to help countries make the switch to greener economies. Our President Nursultan Nazarbayev has called for Expo 2017 to drive Kazakhstan's third industrial revolution, especially by focusing on renewable power, new hi-tech industries, and the creation of a highly skilled workforce. The United States is playing a key role in Expo 2017 and this is symbolic of Kazakhstan's broader relationship with the United States, a multifaceted relationship that has achieved significant success on the global stage.

    Kazakhstan and President Nazarbayev have hosted numerous regional conferences focused on counter-terrorism in Central Asia. As one of the few countries that has voluntarily given up nuclear weapons, Kazakhstan has been and will continue to be a partner for the United States in its ongoing efforts to promote nuclear non-proliferation around the world.

    In the energy sector, Kazakhstan is commercializing innovative renewable and alternative energy technologies, exploring new reserves in its sizable Tengiz and Kashagan oil and gas fields together with American companies, and working to build trade and transport networks across Central Asia that bolster regional economies, including Afghanistan. Finally, Kazakhstan is continuing its role as a global leader in the promotion of interfaith dialogue for religious tolerance and conflict resolution.

    Expo 2017 represents a clear opportunity for the United States and Kazakhstan to expand their excellent political and security relations further into the realm of economics, investment, and bilateral commercial deals. The United States government and the U.S. private sector halready made a significant commitment to Expo. American companies understand its value in showcasing the technology and innovation that the United States holds in energy.  EXPO 2017 should be seen as the first step in a larger effort to leverage Kazakhstan's unique standing among American friends and partners around the world, using the bilateral relationship to help address issues of critical importance to the United States.

    The United States and Kazakhstan have both entered a new era – one defined by innovative thinking and steadfast focus on the need to achieve results. We must seize the moment.

    Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev met Oct. 24 with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in Astana on Ross’s first day in Kazakhstan.

    Ross visited Kazakhstan for three days as part of a Central Asian tour and also met with Kazakh Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, government ministers and officials overseeing economy, trade and investments. He also participated in business forums in Astana and Almaty, where 16 American companies and Kazakh businesses were expected to sign commercial deals.

    President Nazarbayev said Ross’s visit indicates interest by the United States in developing cooperation with Central Asia.

    “During our meeting with President Donald Trump, we have reached an understanding. As it reads in our statement, Kazakh-American relations reached the level of an expanded strategic partnership. I met with a large group of U.S. business captains; with the trade volume at $2 billion, we signed 27 different commercial documents totalling $7 billion, and today trade grew by another 30 percent,” Nazarbayev noted.

    Kazakh-American relations are rooted in Kazakhstan’s decision to abandon its nuclear weapons and close the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, followed by the signing of the first cooperation agreement with then President George W. Bush. At that time, Chevron was among the pioneers of investing in Kazakhstan, whose history, as the Kazakh President stated, “shows how one can successfully conduct business in Kazakhstan.”

    “Kazakhstan is pursuing a multi-vector policy and maintains good relations with all of its partner countries,” Nazarbayev stressed.

    Ross said he was impressed by Astana’s success.

    “This is my first time in Kazakhstan, I was struck by the architecture of your capital that I witnessed on my way from the airport,” he said.

    The secretary, accompanied by 16 major U.S. businesses, noted Kazakhstan’s economic growth and active construction industry, conveyed greetings from Trump and thanked Nazarbayev for the opportunity to discuss Kazakh-American cooperation.

    In a separate meeting with high-level government officials led by Prime Minister Sagintayev, the American delegation discussed expanding trade and investment cooperation as well as implementing agreements reached in January.

    NEW YORK, January 2, 2019- The Permanent Mission of Kazakhstan to the United Nations has organised an official ceremony for the installation of the national flags of the countries elected to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for 2019-2020. Belgium, the Dominican Republic, Germany, Indonesia, and South Africa have taken over as the Security Council's non-permanent members from Bolivia, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

    The first ceremony of accession to the UNSC of the new non-permanent members was held at the initiative of Kazakhstan in January 2018, during its presidency of the Council. The UN member states noted that this new tradition was a “bright calling card” of Kazakhstan.

    Previously, the changing of the flags of the UNSC's non-permanent members against the press wall in front of the Security Council Hall was of a purely technical nature. Since the introduction of this initiative, the procedure has turned into an official event attended by representatives of the UN member states and top-tier global media outlets.

    “The solemn ceremony aims at demonstrating the recognition and respect to the new members of the UN Security Council. All 15 members of the Council unanimously confirmed that the ceremony would be an annual tradition of the UN Security Council,” Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the UN Kairat Umarov noted.

    Taking into consideration the significance of the event, the Ambassador noted the Kazakh delegation's commitment to continuing the tradition in the future. Mr. Umarov expressed his warmest wishes to the newly-appointed non-permanent UNSC members during their work towards the maintenance of global peace and security in the main UN body, calling it a unique opportunity and honour for any state to be a member of the Security Council.

    To demonstrate deep respect to the UNSC and its members, the Permanent Mission of Kazakhstan presented bespoke stands for the flags of the Security Council member states, manufactured in Kazakhstan and made in the national style of the country.

    The event was attended by the Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic Miguel Vargas, the permanent representatives of Belgium, Germany, Indonesia, and South Africa, the permanent representatives of the states that have completed their missions to the UNSC alongside Kazakhstan, as well as representatives of other states, the UN Secretariat and international media.

    Kazakhstan completed its two-year work as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council on 31 December 2018.

    Dear friends!

    On behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan and on my own account, I congratulate you on the upcoming New Year!

    The past 2018 will be remembered for the undeniable success of our state's foreign policy. We have successfully completed non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council, which has become a serious test and achievement for Kazakhstan`s diplomacy.

    I should point out that the new 2019 will be no less intense and important. The head of state set before us a serious task of effectively “economizing" foreign policy, in particular, further increasing the pace of attracting foreign investment and supporting Kazakhstan's exports.

    Modern diplomacy is facing a mass of new challenges, which undoubtedly affects Kazakhstan's diplomacy. Under these conditions, we will continue serious work on the system restructuring of our work. In the new year, we will present an updated Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it will be even more dynamic, even more mobile, even more focused on results.

    In order to promote “economic" diplomacy, the process of interagency cooperation is gaining momentum.

    The implementation of the instructions of the country's leadership will be carried out in conjunction with other central and executive government bodies.


    Much work lies ahead of us. We face high goals - ensuring the interests of our country and promoting the economic well-being of the people of Kazakhstan.

    On the eve of the holiday, I would like to wish everyone happiness, personal growth, inspiration and fulfillment of their cherished desires. Let the new 2019 year give you new emotions and discoveries! Health, family welfare and success in work!

    Best regards,

    __Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan__

    On behalf of the American people, I warmly congratulate the people of Kazakhstan as you celebrate 27 years of your nation’s independence on December 16.

    Following President Nazarbayev’s trip to Washington, which charted a path forward for increased cooperation between our two countries, the United States and Kazakhstan have embarked on an enhanced strategic partnership. We congratulate Kazakhstan on the upcoming successful conclusion of its two-year term as rotating chair in the United Nations Security Council, and have appreciated the leadership Kazakhstan has brought to the world stage on regional security and development issues, particularly with respect to Afghanistan. We also express our appreciation to the Government of Kazakhstan for deploying its first peacekeeping force to assist the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. Kazakhstan has assumed a key role on the global stage as a partner in ensuring peace and stability, and in promoting economic development and connectivity in Central Asia and beyond.

    We look forward to continuing to expand our dynamic relationship with Kazakhstan in new ways for the benefit of both the Kazakhstani and American people.

    __The President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev has re-shuffled the cabinet, appointed a new foreign minister and given the ministry new powers and responsibilities for attracting foreign investment.__

    On 26 December, Nazarbayev reorganised three ministries and appointed new ministers through a string of presidential decrees.

    The President significantly strengthened the economic diplomacy credentials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by giving it oversight over the work on attracting foreign investment and promoting Kazakh exports abroad, taking away these responsibilities from the reformed Ministry for Investment and Development.

    He appointed Beibut Atamkulov as Minister of Foreign Affairs and relieved former Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov of his responsibilities due to his transfer to another job, as yet unannounced.

    Atamkulov, an engineer by training, has worked in the private sector and in government institutions, having served as a career diplomat from 2006.

    EURACTIV spoke to deputy foreign minister Roman Vassilenko, who said the re-shuffle of the foreign ministry was aimed at working in a much more focused way on attracting foreign investment and promoting Kazakh exports abroad.

    He also said that with his long, diverse and successful career in private business, government institutions and in the diplomatic service, Atamkulov would infuse “new energy and new vision” in the country’s international efforts.

    “Europeans may also be interested to learn that [Atamkulov] has previously served as our Consul General in Frankfurt where he was primarily focused on working with German and European companies interested in cooperating with Kazakhstan,” Vassilenko said.

    Asked what was the reason for putting more emphasis on FDI, Vassilenko explained that globally, foreign investment were decreasing (by 23% for 2017, according to UNCTAD), and that the response would be to focus on quality investment that comes with advanced technologies.

    He recalled that Kazakhstan had attracted $300 billion dollars in FDI during its 27 years as an independent state, but stated that the lion’s share of these went into the extractive industries, primarily oil and gas.

    “So, as we seek to further modernise our economy in order to reach our goal of joining the top 30 most developed countries by 2050, we naturally need to strengthen our efforts to attract a diversified range of foreign investments and technologies as part of mutually beneficial partnerships,” Vassilenko said.

    The diplomat explained that agribusiness, the production of machinery, equipment and motor vehicles, as well as the chemical, pharmaceutical, metallurgy and construction industries have been identified as among the highest priority areas for attracting investors, and those were the sectors Kazakhstan provided significant benefits for investors.

    Fiscal preferences, he said, were offered for 10 years on corporate and land tax, as well as for 8 years on property tax. Moreover, companies could also benefit from an investment subsidies payment, which takes the form of a monetary reimbursement of up to 30% of the construction, installation and equipment costs.

    There is also a possibility of receiving state in-kind (natural) grants in the form of public property including temporary free land use, Vassilenko explained.

    __Strategic relation with EU__

    The European Union is by far, Kazakhstan’s largest trading and investment partner, accounting for almost half of our foreign trade and investment, Vassilenko stressed.

    “We intend to continue strengthening the foundations for this economic success story, including through the full entry into force of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) between Kazakhstan and the EU and its member states,” he added.

    The diplomat mentioned industrial cooperation with French companies such as Alstom in assembling electric locomotives in Kazakhstan, and the production of switch electric drives for railways, totalling $1.2 billion of investment in 20 years. Another French company, Auber & Duval, has reportedly invested in the production of titanium parts for European Airbus planes under a joint venture, with investment totalling $70 million.

    Other examples mentioned were the production of passenger railway cars with Spanish company Talgo. German companies such as Knauf, Heidelberg Cement, and Bayer are implementing projects focused on the production of construction materials and pharmaceutical products. In agribusiness, multinational dairy producers Danone and Lactalis transform sour milk products in Kazakhstan, Vassilenko said.

    “More and more European investors continue to recognise the opportunities for maximising revenue in Kazakhstan, as well as the opportunities to establish a foothold in Central Asia and gain access to the Eurasian Economic Union – a marketplace of over 180 million consumers,” Vassilenko said.

    Kazakhstan, together with Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, is a member of the Russia-led Eurasia Economic Union, a political and economic union of states in Europe and Asia, loosely modelled on the EU.

    Vassilenko said that another important factor to consider in terms of potential for foreign investment was Kazakhstan’s proximity to China and the country’s participation in the development of the Silk Road of the 21st century, including through its own Nurly Zhol infrastructure development program and through cooperation within the Belt and Road Initiative.

    Nurly Zhol is a $9 billion domestic economic stimulus plan to develop and modernise roads, railways, ports, IT infrastructure, education and civil services in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

    WASHINGTON – Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev met Jan. 16 with U.S. President Donald J. Trump at the White House during Nazarbayev’s two-day official visit to the United States, the first such visit at the invitation of the country’s leader since 2006.

    After the pomp, ceremony and protocol at noon, the two leaders met in a closed-door session followed by an extended meeting with cabinet members from both countries present. They also held a joint press conference and a working luncheon.

    The leaders agreed to elevate bilateral cooperation to the level of enhanced strategic partnership, which, in Nazarbayev’s words, “would signal the new era of the relations between Kazakhstan and the United States.”

    In his press remarks before the bilateral meeting, Trump greeted Nazarbayev as “the highly respected” leader, adding that Kazakhstan is America’s “valued friend and a strategic partner in Central Asia” and the two countries have “a tremendous relationship in terms of economics.”

    Trump also reminded the press of the meeting he had had with Nazarbayev in Saudi Arabia on the sidelines of the Arab-Islamic-American Summit back in May 2017 and said the two had “developed an immediate relationship.”

    In a joint statement titled “Kazakhstan and the United States: An Enhanced Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century,” Nazarbayev and Trump reaffirmed Kazakhstan’s independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as the Central Asian nation’s role in advancing global peace and prosperity.

    “President Trump noted Kazakhstan’s global leadership as an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 2017-2018,” the statement read, and “praised its legacy as a leader in international non-proliferation efforts, beginning with the voluntary renunciation of its nuclear arsenal in 1992, and reinforced by on-going commitments to nuclear security and recent support for preventing the spread and use of chemical weapons.”

    The statement, which covered issues from Astana’s leadership role globally and regionally, to defence and security cooperation, including in Afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism and extremism, to economic partnership and the human dimension, attached a renewed importance to the role of the regional Central Asia plus the U.S. dialogue format, known as C5+1, in addressing shared challenges in the region.

    Given the positive developments towards greater integration in Central Asia over the past year, it came as no surprise that Nazarbayev said he arrived in Washington, “representing Central Asia, in the format of the five Central Asian countries.”

    During the negotiations, Nazarbayev and Trump touched upon a wide range of bilateral and multilateral issues, including strengthening cooperation on political and security issues, trade and investments and people-to-people relationships through regular high-level meetings within the framework of an Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue.

    High on the agenda was the issue of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, which the two leaders condemned.

    “Kazakhstan has a moral right to talk to the nations that are seeking nuclear weapons,” said Nazarbayev. “This is why we’re talking to Iran, and this is the way we will be talking to North Korea.”

    He also said, “the issue of North Korea could be solved by joining the efforts of the U.S., China and Russia. And Kazakhstan, being a neighbour of Russia physically, of course, is following very closely the dynamics the U.S. and Russian relations, which suddenly plunged into the abyss.”

    On Afghanistan and regional security, the U.S. President thanked Nazarbayev for supporting the United States’ South Asia strategy by guaranteeing continuous logistical support and access to Afghanistan and contributing to humanitarian efforts.

    He also praised Kazakhstan’s support “for fair burden sharing” through past and future financial contributions to the Afghan security forces, as well as the offer to extend an Afghan specialist programme in cooperation with the U.S. to train Afghan civilian and security personnel at Kazakh universities.

    With regard to Syria, Nazarbayev briefed Trump on Kazakhstan’s efforts to bring about peace in Syria through hosting a series of negotiations in the nation’s capital, known as the Astana Process. The two leaders welcomed “diplomatic initiatives that achieve any genuine de-escalation of violence and strengthen the basis for a political settlement of conflict,” the joint statement read. To date, there have been seven rounds of Syrian peace talks in Astana in 2017.

    The visit coincided with Kazakhstan’s January presidency in the UN Security Council and, according to Trump, bilateral “cooperation has grown even stronger this month” during the Central Asian nation’s tenure in the UN body.

    Nazarbayev’s visit to the United States, the seventh in the history of bilateral relations, has sent an important political signal for expanding the countries’ bilateral business ties, deepening trade, economic, investment and innovation-technological partnership.

    The U.S. is one of Kazakhstan’s most important economic partners, with investments in Kazakhstan, according to the official report from Akorda, totalling around $50 billion and making the U.S. one of the largest investors into the Kazakh economy. Currently, more than 500 American companies have operations in Kazakhstan.

    In the 10 months of 2017, two-way trade between Kazakhstan and the U.S. totalled $1.38 billion. Kazakhstan’s goods imports from the U.S., including aircraft, machinery, poultry meat and beef, electrical machinery, iron and steel products, prepared food, planting seeds, wine and beer, and snack foods, were $1.04 billion. Kazakhstan’s total exports of products to the U.S., which mostly consist of mineral fuels, ores, slag, uranium, thorium, iron and steel, inorganic chemicals and other base metals, totalled $339 million.

    The Nazarbayev-Trump meeting was followed by a business forum with American executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which resulted in the conclusion of around 20 agreements worth $7.5 billion.

    Nazarbayev noted Kazakhstan and the U.S had reciprocally introduced 10-year business and tourism visas back in December 2016, a decision that marked the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

    He also said work is underway to open direct flights between Kazakhstan and the United States.

    The two presidents pledged to promote a fair and reciprocal economic partnership that increases bilateral trade and investment and creates jobs and opportunities in both countries.

    Trump applauded Kazakhstan’s ambitious plans to develop a diverse and innovative economy with investment-friendly climate, noting that U.S. development finance institutions seek to support investments in Kazakhstan.

    “He’s on his way – very rapidly,” said Trump of Nazarbayev in reference to the strategy announced by the Kazakh leader back in 2012 to become a top 30 global economy by 2050.

    The leaders pledged to explore bilateral cooperation in the digital economy, healthcare, infrastructure, civil aviation, finance and banking, agriculture, and energy sectors.

    They reinforced their commitment to the Central Asia Trade Forum and the Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).  Kazakhstan and the United States also plan to strengthen cooperation in the use of space technologies to assess environmental hazards and mitigate the threat of natural disasters in Kazakhstan.

    Another major topic of discussions for Nazarbayev was the sanctions issue, which the leaders agreed to consult on to avoid any unintended consequences for Kazakhstan’s economy.

    The programme of Nazarbayev’s visit also included a working breakfast with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, meetings with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Ray Washburne and others on political and energy issues.

    On Jan. 17, Nazarbayev was to visit the Library of Congress, which came as a testament to the strong cultural ties, evidenced by bilateral partnerships, agreements and exchanges.

    Nazarbayev’s visit to the U.S. will continue in New York Jan. 18 where he will chair the UNSC Members’ High-Level Thematic Debate on “Non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: confidence-building measures” at the UN headquarters.

    *By Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev*

    Space is the measure of all things, time is the measure of all events. When the horizons of space and time merge, national history begins. And this is not just a beautiful aphorism.

    In fact, if you think about the history of the German, Italian or Indian people, the question of the relationship between the territory and the great achievements of these peoples during a thousand-year history quite rightly arises. Of course, Ancient Rome and modern Italy are not the same, but the Italians are justly proud of their roots. The ancient Goths and modern Germans are also not one and the same people, but they are all part of Germany’s vast historical heritage. Ancient India with its rich polyethnic culture and the modern Indian people are naturally considered as one unique civilization, continuing its development in an uninterrupted stream of history.

    And this is the right approach, allowing you to understand your origins, and indeed the entire national history in all its depth and complexity.

    The history of Kazakhstan should also be understood from the height of modern science, and not by its separate fragments. There are convincing arguments for this.

    Firstly, the majority of proto-state associations, the contribution of which will be discussed below, were formed on the territory of Kazakhstan, becoming one of the elements of the ethnogenesis of the Kazakh nation.

    Secondly, those outstanding cultural achievements that will be discussed were not brought into the steppe, but in most cases were born on our land and only then spread to the West and East, North and South.

    Thirdly, the historical finds of the last decades clearly confirm the indissoluble connection of our ancestors with the most advanced technological innovations of their time and allow us to take a fresh look at the Great Steppe’s place in global history.

    Finally, the names of some Kazakh tribes and clans are many hundreds of years older than the ethnonym "Kazak", which undoubtedly indicates a completely different horizon of national history than previously thought.

    The Eurocentric point of view did not allow to see the real fact that the Sakas, the Huns, the Proto-Turkic ethnic groups were part of the ethnogenesis of our nation.

    In addition, it is fundamentally important to note that we are talking about the history of Kazakhstan, which is common to many ethnic groups living on our territory for a long time. This is our common history, the contribution to which was made by many prominent figures of different ethnicity.

    Today we need a positive view of our own history. However, it should not be reduced to only the selective and opportunistic coverage of a particular historical event. Black is an inseparable companion of white. Together they form the unique color gamut of life of both an individual and whole nations. In our history there were many dramatic moments and tragedies, deadly wars and conflicts, socially dangerous experiments and political cataclysms. We have no right to forget about them. It is necessary to realize and accept your history in all its versatility and multidimensionality.

    The purpose is not to show one’s greatness by belittling the role of other nations. The aim is to calmly and objectively understand our role in global history, based on strict scientific facts.

    So, here are the seven facets of the Great Steppe.

    * * *

    __I. Space and time of national history__

    Our land, without exaggeration, has become the place from where many objects of material culture originate. Much of that, without which the life of modern society is simply unthinkable, was once invented in our area. In their development, the inhabitants of the steppes opened to the world many technical innovations, became the forefathers of inventions, which are still used in all parts of the world. The chronicles preserve a lot of well-known facts, which show how the ancestors of the Kazakhs repeatedly changed the course of political and economic history over vast areas of Eurasia.

    1. Culture of horsemanship

    Everyone knows that the Great Steppe gave the world horse breeding and the culture of horsemanship.

    For the first time, the domestication of horses by a human took place on the territory of modern Kazakhstan, as evidenced by excavations of the Botai settlement in the north of the country.

    The domestication of the horse gave our ancestors an unthinkable superiority at that time, and on the global scale made the biggest revolution in the economy and military affairs.

    However, the domestication of the horse marked the beginning of a culture of horsemanship. A rider on a horse, armed with a bow, lance or saber, became a symbol of the era when powerful empires created by nomadic peoples came to the forefront of history.

    The image of the equestrian standard-bearer is the most recognizable emblem of the heroic era and a special “cultural code” of the nomadic world, the formation of which is associated with the birth of horsemanship.

    The power of car engines is still measured in horsepower. And this long-standing tradition is a symbolic tribute to that great era when the horseman dominated the planet.

    We should not forget that humankind enjoyed the fruits of this great technological revolution right up to the XIX century, which came into the world from the ancient Kazakh land.

    The basic components of modern clothing go back to the ancient era of the steppe civilisation. The culture of horsemanship gave rise to optimal clothing for the rider-warrior. Striving for convenience and practicality during riding, our ancestors for the first time divided clothing into upper and lower parts. Therefore they invented the first types of trousers.

    This gave riders the freedom to ride and battle. Those that lived in the steppe sewed trousers from leather, felt, hemp, wool and flax. Over the past thousand years, this type of clothing has not changed fundamentally. Ancient trousers found during excavations have the same shape as modern ones.

    It is also known that today all the varieties of boots are the "successors" of soft shoes with a shaft and heel, which nomads used for riding.

    In an effort to improve the control of the horse while riding, the people of the steppe invented the high saddle and stirrups. Innovations allowed the rider to sit confidently on a horse and, even when moving quickly, to more efficiently use his weapon - a bow, a spear, a sword.

    Our ancestors brought to perfection archery at a gallop - it changed the design of the weapon: it became composite, more comfortable to use and more deadly, and the arrows got plumage and a metal tip, piercing armor.

    Another technological innovation introduced by the Turkic tribes that inhabited the territory of Kazakhstan was the invention of a saber, the distinctive feature of which was a straight or curved blade with a handle turned in the direction of the blade. These weapons became the most important and common in the arsenal of offensive weapons.

    Our ancestors were the first to create protective armor for the horse and the rider from armour plates. This led to the appearance of a heavily armed cavalry - the most important military innovation of the Eurasian nomads. Its evolution in the period from I millennium BC until the first century influenced the creation of a special kind of troops - heavy cavalry, which for a long time ensured an unprecedented military superiority of the steppe men, up to the invention and mass use of firearms.

    __2. Ancient metallurgy of the Great Steppe__

    The invention of methods for producing metals opened a new historical era and forever changed the course of human development. The Kazakh land, rich in diverse metal ores, also became one of the first centres of establishment of metallurgy. The centres of mining production and smelting of bronze, copper, lead, iron, silver and gold, and the manufacture of sheet iron arose in the ancient antiquity on the lands of Central, Northern and Eastern Kazakhstan.

    Our ancestors constantly developed the production of new, more durable metals, which opened up opportunities for them to accelerate technological progress. This is evidenced by the furnaces found during the excavations, which were used to smelt metal, decorations, household items and weapons of earlier eras. This indicates a high technological development of the steppe civilizations that existed on our land in ancient times.

    __3. Animal style__

    Our ancestors lived in complete harmony with the outside world and considered themselves an inseparable part of nature. This key principle of being formed the worldview and values of the peoples of the Great Steppe. The ancient inhabitants of Kazakhstan had a highly developed culture - they had their own writing and mythology.

    The most striking element of their heritage, a reflection of the artistic originality and richness of spiritual content is the "art of animal style." The use of images of animals in everyday life was a symbol of the interrelation of man and nature, pointing to the spiritual guides of the steppe people.

    They preferred images of predators, mostly felines. It is most likely not by chance that the snow leopard, a rare and noble representative of the local fauna, has become one of the symbols of sovereign Kazakhstan.

    At the same time, the animal style reflects the highest production skills of our ancestors - artistic carvings and the technique of working with metals are well known: the smelting and casting of copper and bronze, the methods for the complex manufacture of gold sheets.

    In general, the phenomenon of "animal style" is one of the highest peaks in world art.

    __4. Golden Man__

    A sensational discovery for world science, which made it possible to take a fresh look at our origins, was the Golden Man, found in Kazakhstan in 1969 in Issyk, referred to in the circles of art scholars as “Kazakhstan’s Tutankhamun”.

    The warrior told us a lot. Our ancestors created the highest-level artistic creations that still amaze the imagination. Skillful golden guise of a warrior indicates confident mastery of the ancient masters of gold processing techniques. It also revealed a rich mythology, reflecting power and aesthetics of the Steppe civilization.

    So the steppe men exalted the personality of the leader, elevated him to the rank of a sun-like deity. The luxurious decoration of the burial introduced us to the intellectual traditions of the ancestors. On one of the silver cups found near the warrior, scribbled marks were found - traces of the oldest writing ever found in Central Asia.

    __5. Cradle of the Turkic world__

    Altai is of great importance for the history of the Kazakhs and other peoples of Eurasia. From time immemorial, these majestic mountains not only decorated the lands of Kazakhstan, but were also the cradle of the Turkic peoples. It was here, in the middle of the 1st millennium, where the Turkic world was born, and a new milestone was reached in the Great Steppe.

    History and geography formed a special model of continuity of the Turkic states, the great steppe empires. For centuries, they have successively replaced each other, leaving their significant mark in the economic, political and cultural landscape of medieval Kazakhstan.

    Having mastered the space within wide geographical boundaries, the Turkic peoples managed to create a symbiosis of nomadic and settled civilizations, which led to the flourishing of medieval cities, which became centres of art, science and world trade. For example, medieval Otyrar gave humanity one of the greatest minds of world civilization, Abu Nasr al-Farabi, while in Turkestan, Khoja Ahmet Yassawi, one of the great spiritual leaders of the Turkic peoples, lived and worked.

    __6. The Great Silk Road__

    The unique geographical location of Kazakhstan - in the very centre of the Eurasian continent - has contributed to the emergence of transit “corridors” between different countries and civilizations since ancient times. Starting from the turn of our era, these land routes were transformed into the Great Silk Road system - a transcontinental network of trade and cultural ties between East and West, North and South of Greater Eurasia.

    It has become a stable platform for the formation and development of the global interchange of goods and intellectual cooperation between nations.

    The key intermediaries of the most important trade route of antiquity and the Middle Ages, ensuring the flawless organisation and safety of transport arteries, were the inhabitants of the Great Steppe. The steppe belt connected the Chinese, Indian, Persian, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Slavic civilizations.

    Since its inception, the Great Silk Road map has largely been located within the Turkic empires. It was during the rule of the Turkic peoples in Central Eurasia that the Great Silk Road reached its peak and promoted economic prosperity and cultural growth on an international scale.

    __7. Kazakhstan - the birthplace of apples and tulips__

    It is scientifically proven that the foothills of the Alatau are the "historic homeland" of apples and tulips. It is from here that these modest, but significant for the whole world plants gradually spread to all countries. And now Kazakhstan is the keeper of the progenitor of all the Earth’s apple trees — the Sievers apple tree. It was this tree that gave the world one of the most common fruits of our time. The apples that we know are the genetic varieties of the fruits of our apple tree species. On the ancient routes of the Silk Road from the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau on the territory of Kazakhstan, it ended up in the Mediterranean and then spread throughout the world. And as a symbol of this long history of the popular fruit, one of the most beautiful cities in the south of our country is called “Almaty”.

    Actually, here, in the Chu-Ili Mountains, we still see in its primal form pearls of Kazakhstan’s flora – the Regel tulips. These beautiful plants appeared on our land in the strip of deserts and foothills of the Tien Shan. From the Kazakh land, these modest but unusual flowers gradually spread around the world, conquering the hearts of many peoples with their beauty.

    Today there are more than 3 thousand varieties of cultivated tulips in the world, and most of them are “descendants” of our local flowers. In Kazakhstan, there are 35 types of tulips.

    __II. Modernisation of historical identity__

    All these issues require serious thought. They relate to the fundamentals of our worldview, the past, present and future of the nation.

    I believe that we can begin this work with several large projects.

    __1. Archive-2025__

    During the years of independence, a lot of work has been done to study the past of our people - the “Cultural Heritage” programme was successfully implemented, which allowed restoring the forgotten fragments of the historical chronicle. However, many documented evidence about the life of ancestors and their unique civilization has not yet been introduced into scientific circulation and are waiting for their hour in numerous archives around the world.

    Therefore, I believe that we need to create the seven-year programme “Archive-2025”, which would include serious fundamental research of all domestic and foreign archives, starting with antiquity and ending with modernity.

    As part of its implementation, it is necessary to focus the research work of special groups of historians, archivists, and cultural scientists on systemic and long-term engagement with domestic and major foreign archives.

    This important activity in all respects should not turn into “academic tourism” at the public expense. It is necessary not only to painstakingly collect archived data, but also to actively convert it into a digital format, making it available to all interested experts and the general public.

    Raising a sense of pride in one’s history, fostering patriotism must begin at school. Therefore, it is important to create a historical and archaeological movement at schools and local history museums in all regions of the country. Being familiar with the national history creates the feeling of unity of their origins among all the people of Kazakhstan.

    __2. The great names of the Great Steppe__

    It is known that the historical process in the mass consciousness is primarily personified. Many nations are deservedly proud of the names of great ancestors who have become the unique ambassadors of their countries.

    For example, such world-famous personalities of bygone eras as Tutankhamun, Confucius, Alexander the Great, Shakespeare, Goethe, Pushkin and George Washington are today invaluable “symbolic capital” for "their states", contributing to their effective promotion in the international arena.

    The Great Steppe also spawned a whole galaxy of prominent figures. Among them are such large-scale figures as Al-Farabi and Yassawi, Kul-Tegin and Beibars, Tauke and Abylay, Kenesary and Abay and many others.

    Therefore, we should, first of all, create an educational Park-Encyclopedia "The Great Names of the Great Steppe", where, under the open sky, sculptural monuments in honour of our famous historical figures and their achievements will be presented.

    Secondly, by organising a targeted state order, it is necessary to initiate the formation of a topical gallery of images of great thinkers, poets and rulers of the past in contemporary literature, music, theater, and visual arts.

    In addition to the classic formats, it is also important to tap the creative potential of alternative youth art. This work can involve not only domestic, but also foreign masters of art and creative teams.

    Thirdly, it is necessary to systematise and step up activities for the creation and dissemination of the popular science series “Outstanding personalities of the Great Steppe” - “Uly Dala Tulgalary”, covering a broad historical horizon.

    In this direction, international multidisciplinary teams can be created, in which, along with Kazakh scientists, foreign specialists will be involved. As a result, the life and activities of our heroes will be known both in our country and abroad.

    __3. The genesis of the Turkic world__

    Kazakhstan, the ancestral homeland of the Turkic peoples, is the sacred "Kara Shanyrak". From here, from our steppes, the Turkic tribes and peoples who made a significant contribution to the historical processes in other countries and regions went to different parts of the world.

    We need to launch the project “Turkic civilization: from the beginnings to the present”, within which it is possible to organise the World Congress of Turkologists in Astana in 2019 and the Days of Culture of the Turkic ethnic groups, where the ancient Turkic artifacts will be displayed in the museums of various countries. It is also important to create a single online library of common Turkic works following the example of Wikipedia, of which Kazakhstan can act as a moderator.

    In addition, as part of the promotion of Turkestan as a new regional centre, it is necessary to strengthen its positioning in the international arena.

    The ancient capital of Kazakhstan is not only the spiritual centre of our people, but also a sacred place for the entire Turkic world.

    __4. The Museum of Ancient Art and Technology of the Great Steppe__

    We have every opportunity to create the Museum of Ancient Art and Technology of the Great Steppe “Uly Dala”. It is possible to collect samples of high art and technology, including artefacts made in animal style, the decoration of the "Golden Man", objects reflecting the process of taming the horse, the development of metallurgy, the manufacture of weapons, equipment and other artifacts. Expand in it the exposition of valuable archaeological finds and archaeological complexes found on the territory of Kazakhstan, which reflect the development process of various sectors of the economy on the territory of our country in certain historical eras.

    And also create the National Club of Historical Reconstructions "Great Civilizations of the Great Steppe" and hold festivals in Astana and the regions of Kazakhstan on its basis: the ancient Saks, Huns, the era of the great Turkic Kagans, etc. Work on these topics can be done simultaneously, bringing together those interested in these subjects.

    The tourist project for the partial restoration of the ancient city of Otyrar with the reconstruction of objects of the urban environment - houses, streets, public places, water supply, city walls, and so on – will be interesting.

    At the same time, it is necessary to focus on the popularisation of knowledge and the development of tourism on this basis.

    __5. A thousand years of steppe folklore and music__

    Within the framework of this project, we need to create an “anthology of steppe folklore”. It will contain the best examples of verbal folk art by the heirs of the Great Steppe over the past millennium - tales, legends, stories, epics.

    In addition, it is necessary to release a collection of "Ancient motifs of the Great Steppe" - a collection of significant works created for traditional Kazakh musical instruments: kobyz, dombra, sybyzgy, sazsyrnay and others.

    The folklore and melodies of the Great Steppe should acquire a “new breath” in a modern digital format. To work on these projects, it is important to attract domestic and foreign professionals who are able not only to systematise, but also to actualise the rich heritage of the Steppe.

    The main plots, characters and motives of our culture have no boundaries and should be systematically researched and promoted throughout the whole of Central Eurasia and in the whole world.

    Modernisation of verbal and musical traditions should acquire formats that are close and comprehensible to the modern audience.

    In particular, ancient words and texts may be accompanied by illustrations or be embodied in the form of vivid video materials. In turn, sounds and melodies can be born not only by means of authentic instruments, but also through modern electronic versions.

    In addition, it is necessary to organise a series of scientific and research expeditions to various regions of Kazakhstan and other countries to search for common historical foundations of the folklore tradition.

    __6. History in film and television__

    In the modern world, cinema occupies a huge place in the self-education of peoples in historical subjects. Bright film images sometimes play a more significant role in mass public perceptions than documentary portraits in scientific monographs.

    Therefore, in the near future it is necessary to launch into production a special cycle of documentary films, television series and feature-length movies that demonstrate the continuity of the civilizational history of Kazakhstan.

    Work on these projects should be carried out within the framework of broad international cooperation involving the best domestic and foreign scriptwriters, directors, actors, producers and other specialists in the modern film industry.

    In addition, it is necessary to maximise the use of genre of the new historical television and film productions, by including elements of fantasy and action-packed blockbusters that are popular today with the audience, as well as adventure and melodramatic motifs.

    For this purpose, it is possible to use the rich mythological and folklore material of the Great Steppe.

    Particular attention should also be paid to the younger generation, which is in dire need of high-quality children's films and animated series that can create a cult of national superheroes.

    Our illustrious warriors, thinkers and rulers deserve to be role models not only in Kazakhstan, but throughout the world.

    __Conclusion__

    A year and a half ago, I published the article “Course towards the future: modernisation of Kazakhstan’s identity,” which found a broad response in society.

    I consider the above projects as a continuation of the programme “Rouhani Zhangyru”.

    The new components of the nationwide programme “Rouhani Zhangyru” will make it possible to bring to reality the centuries-old heritage of our ancestors, making it understandable and in demand in the current conditions of the digital civilization.

    I am convinced that the people who remember, appreciate, and are proud of their history have a great future. Pride in the past, a pragmatic assessment of the present and a positive outlook into the future - this is the key to the success of our country.

    Ambassador Erzhan Kazykhanov and his wife Danara made their first Colorado visit after being invited by South Metro Denver Chamber’s Doug Tisdale, who met the ambassador through the Consular Corps of Colorado’s Dean Dr. Deborah A. Palmieri, Honorary Consul General of Russia. The chamber held a reception for the ambassador, his wife, and their party at the Lone Tree Hub Jan. 25.

    In his speech to the 60 local elected officials and business executives at the afternoon reception, Kazykhanov said Kazakhstan presently uses only 30 percent of its arable lands and is working closely with Israel and an American company to increase its use of irrigation.

    He focused on the increasing development of medical tourism in Kazakhstan, especially for treatment of cancer and heart disease. Investing in the health care sector, representatives of Kazakhstan recently brought a new cancer treatment developed in Wisconsin and they are working with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to bring in other state-of-the-art medical treatments and technology.

    __Kazakhstan and the US will sign an agreement on launching direct flights between the two countries on "open sky" principle in March__, Trend reports citing Kazakhstan's Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Zhenis Kasymbek.

    "The ministry has prepared the draft intergovernmental agreement on air service between Kazakhstan and the US on "open sky" principle. It is planned to sign this agreement in March this year," he said, KazInform reports.

    Further, he noted that together with Air Astana, the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure will work this year on opening air service to Japan, New York, Shanghai and other large cities of the world.

    The procedure of accreditation for flights to the US has been launched this year, added the minister.

    The signing of the "open sky" agreement will create a legal basis for opening direct flights between Kazakhstan and the US.

    Recently, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev has instructed to open direct flights between Kazakhstan and the US, as well as with Japan.

    Twenty-one airlines operate in Kazakhstan, only four of which are really big enough to be called national carriers and compete in the Kazakh market of passenger air travel services.

    Air Astana, SCAT, Bek Air and Qazaq Air are the leaders in the Kazakh skies, annually transporting thousands of people and thousands of tons of goods.

    Glaciers are retreating around the globe, which will mean less water for people and crops in the future. The New York Times reporters traveled to Kazakhstan's Tuyuksu glacier to see the impact of climate change on mountain glaciers. The important story is accompanied with a fantastic multimedia visual that presents the magnitude of the issue.

    Global climate change is one of the topics that Kazakhstan takes seriously. Kazakhstan has made a commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 15% in the next few years and has introduced policies to improve energy efficiency and increase the supply of renewable energy.

    __In today’s highly competitive global environment, economic and trade ties are an increasingly important part of international diplomacy. Nowadays, official government visits focus not only on international political issues, but also on developing closer economic cooperation, encouraging investment and promoting exports. Embassies deal with diplomatic and consular issues and also increasingly engage with foreign investors, businesses, and trade organisations.__

    President Nursultan Nazarbayev was, therefore, right to task the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attract high quality foreign direct investment to Kazakhstan. Under the ministry’s expanded remit, it will be responsible not just for attracting FDI but also for promoting the export of the country’s products around the world.

    These changes make sense. As President Nazarbayev noted, the foreign ministry’s staff speak numerous languages and know the countries of their missions’ presence well. Perhaps, most importantly, the ministry has the ability to conduct economic diplomacy through embassies and foreign missions across the globe.

    The newly appointed Foreign Minister Beibut Atamkulov is the right person to lead this important change. He has dedicated most of his career to the economic success of Kazakhstan. His decades of professional experience, working closely with foreign businesses, will give the MFA the economic vision and leadership it needs to meet this important challenge.

    Each year the foreign ministry and its global diplomats help to organise more than 300 trade, economic and investment events and approximately 600 foreign delegation visits to Kazakhstan and vice versa. Such engagements have already facilitated an increase in foreign direct investment and the President’s most recent changes will provide even greater impetus.

    Building upon this, major achievements were made in 2018 in the sphere of economic diplomacy. This included implementing agreements reached by President Nazarbayev during foreign visits and promoting the transit and transport potential of Kazakhstan through the Nurly Zhol programme, which enables major investment in Kazakhstan’s infrastructure, as well as in conjunction with China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

    These will remain important priorities for 2019, in addition to supporting Kazakhstan’s domestic companies and developing the tourism industry (the foreign ministry is directly involved in helping implement the state programme for tourism). Enabling foreign direct investment, promoting exports, as well as contributing to the development of the Eurasian Economic Union, are also amongst other important priorities.

    When it comes to securing foreign investment, Kazakhstan has attracted more than 300 billion dollars in FDI since independence, making the country the leading investment destination in Central Asia. Over the past two years alone, foreign investors have invested over 20 billion dollars annually in Kazakhstan’s economy.

    However, attracting high-quality investment is becoming even more competitive, with many countries around the world vying for the same foreign business and reliable sources of capital. For this reason, it is important for Kazakhstan to continually adapt to new global realities and stay ahead of the curve.

    As a Kazakh deputy foreign minister noted during a recent interview, “As we seek to further modernise our economy in order to reach our goal of joining the top 30 most developed countries by 2050, we naturally need to strengthen our efforts to attract a diversified range of foreign investments and technologies.”

    The foreign ministry will now oversee the work of the Committee for Investment, as well as the work of Kazakh Invest, the national company tasked with attracting FDI to Kazakhstan. This expanded remit will give the foreign ministry the additional capabilities and resources needed to deliver for Kazakhstan and its people.

    Placing economic diplomacy under the remit of the foreign ministry, an organisation with extensive international experience, is a positive and forward-thinking decision. It will help to safeguard Kazakhstan’s economic future and have a clear impact on our country’s ability to attract foreign investment and promote the exports of a diverse range of national products.

    In a highly competitive global environment, this move will ensure Kazakhstan can remain the top investment destination in Central Asia and an economic powerhouse in the wider region.

    __Nazarbayev University (NU) will host the 2019 Harvard College Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) Asia Conference in mid-August, reports the university’s press service.__

    The HPAIR Asia Conference is a five-day annual conference established in 1991 as a platform for students and young professionals to discuss the economy, politics and society in the Asia-Pacific region. It has been held at universities in 12 countries with more than 32,000 participants.

    World leaders, Nobel laureates, diplomats and international organisation heads comprise conference speakers, with notable past speakers featuring former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, Zipcar Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Robin Chase and former Goldman Sachs Asia President Philip Murphy.

    NU won an international bid to host the event over applications from universities in China, India, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Last year’s Asia conference was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This year, the event will be in Astana during Kazakhstan’s Year of Youth.

    The NU Organising Committee is headed by NU Student Government President Leila Akhmetova. She noted that a delegation of the HPAIR Organising Committee recently visited Astana to discuss event organisation and the NU organising committee will soon visit Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts to continue event preparation talks. The event’s agenda will feature six thematic panels on social policy and inclusive development; world economy, security and diplomacy; business and technology; environmental sustainability and energy; and culture and media.

    HPAIR is a student-run organisation of Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and organises Harvard University’s largest student-run conference in Asia. The conference is to provide a dynamic forum of exchange on international issues, foster long-term relationships among young leaders and connect delegates with today’s leaders in academia, business and government.

    Nazarbayev University is an English-medium autonomous educational and research university in Astana and was founded on Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s initiative in 2010. It aims to become the national brand of Kazakhstan’s higher education, combining the advantages of the national education system and the world’s best scientific and educational practices.

    __Kazakh figure skater Elizabet Tursynbayeva won the women’s singles silver medal at the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships in Anaheim, California (U.S.).__

    She placed sixth in her short programme, but the 139.37 points in her free programme gave her a combined total of 207.46 points and the second-place finish. Japanese skaters Rika Kihira took the gold with 221.99 points and Mai Mihara, the bronze (207.12), reported sports.kz.

    Tursynbayeva fell during her free programme while trying to perform a quadruple salchow (a jump with a take-off from a back inside edge of one foot), but completed her seven triple jumps flawlessly. Her free programme score was her best of the season.

    “I started working on the quadruple salchow a long time ago, but then I stopped because of injury. Now, I feel that I am already physically ready. My coaches helped me work on this jump and a couple of weeks ago I began to successfully perform it during training. I included it in the programme only two weeks ago. I will try it on and do it better. This is my goal,” she said.

    Tursynbayeva became the first Kazakh athlete to win a medal at the International Skating Union (ISU) championship, according to its website.

    Since May, she has been training with the team of renowned Russian specialist Eteri Tutberidze. After the championship, she plans to perform at the 2019 Universiade in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, and World Championships in Japan.

    “We plan to participate in the Universiade, where we would like to re-show and perform the quadruple salchow. Then, we will participate in the World Championship. We plan to make a good and serious statement about ourselves. We will not stop training with the end of the season. We will look for a new programme, music and image, learn new elements and sew costumes for new programmes. In the summer, we will gather in Novogorsk,” said team member Sergey Dudakov in an interview with olympic.kz.

    The ISU Four Continents Figure Skating Championships have been held annually since 1999. Skaters compete in singles, pairs and ice dancing. Twenty-four athletes participated in this year’s women’s singles championship.

    __One of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy priorities is to pursue inclusive dialogue between leading powers to overcome “bloc thinking” and reach consensus on key global issues, new Kazakh Foreign Minister Beibut Atamkulov told ambassadors and envoys during his first meeting with the diplomatic corps in Astana on Feb. 7.__

    The meeting is an annual ritual to brief the diplomatic corps on foreign policy goals. “The main task of (the government) is to enhance the welfare and quality of life of citizens, as it has been defined by the President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the responsibility of the Ministry is to ensure favourable external conditions for the sustainable socio-economic development of the country by political and diplomatic means,” the minister said.

    He also told the corps that developing multilateral and multi-level diplomacy is a strategic foreign policy resource. He said Kazakhstan continues to advocate for diplomatic solutions to conflicts and increased collective responsibility.

    Atamkulov noted Kazakhstan will continue to push for the meeting between global powers, such as the United States, Russia, China and European Union. He also reminded the diplomatic corps of Kazakhstan’s nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts and plans to open a United Nations Regional Hub in Almaty. He also noted Kazakhstan will continue to seek a resolution to the Syrian crisis through the Astana Process peace talks.

    The minister also noted that high-level events involving the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building in Asia, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation and other major international organisations are planned for 2019.

    Kazakhstan will host in 2019 the First World Congress of Turkologists, the 12th Astana Economic Forum and the Fourth Meeting of Speakers of Parliaments in Eurasia, he said.

    The foreign minister also briefed the gathering on Kazakhstan’s priorities for interaction between Kazakhstan and individual nations around the world.

    The ministry, said Atamkulov, seeks to improve the investment climate in accordance with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standards. Kazakhstan, in cooperation with the World Bank, has also adopted a National Investment Strategy.. The country also plans to use its Astana International Financial Centre, International Centre for the Development of Green Technologies, Astana Hub and other entities to expand economic relations in the innovation and service sectors

    The country will also continue to codify its historical and cultural heritage through the Ruhani Janghyru (Modernisation of Kazakhstan’s Identity) Programme and promote that heritage internationally.

    “We expect that cultural and humanitarian cooperation will become a significant factor in external relations,” he said.

    The minister also noted that Kazakhstan recently reached agreements with 20 countries on visa exemptions for general passport holders. These agreements are in addition to existing agreements with 45 countries allowing visa-free entry into Kazakhstan for up to 30 days, including all member states of the OECD and the European Union. Kazakhstan also launched Jan. 1 a pilot project to issue single entry visas electronically.

    __The Kazakh Ministry of Defence is preparing the second contingent of Kazakh soldiers to be deployed as peacekeepers in Lebanon. The troops are expected to be deployed at the end of April.__

    “This is a matter of national importance, since it is the fulfilment by the Republic of Kazakhstan of its obligations to the world community,” said Minister of Defence Nurlan Yermekbayev at his recent working visit to the Iliyski training site in the Almaty region.

    The peacekeeping unit is set to patrol the area, organise observation posts and monitor the cease-fire in accordance with the United Nations mandate.

    Experienced peacekeeping officers have been training 120 troops. The soldiers learn the UN general provisions, train to patrol and provide service at roadblocks, reported the Ministry of Defence’s press service. They learn to peacefully resolve conflicts and use weapons only in critical situations for protection.

    All the soldiers passed through highly selective criteria to train for the UN mission. The first condition is that a candidate must have served at least five years in the Kazakh Armed Forces. Apart from being in an excellent physical shape and health, the candidate is also required to have advanced level of English. The commission accepted soldiers between 25 and 50 years old.

    There are plans to increase the number of Kazakh peacekeepers trained at the Iliyski base. The ministry is interested in having more soldiers with experience working in “difficult military-political situation areas and unfamiliar physiographic conditions,” said the minister.

    “Being on a mission, be bold, courageous, disciplined soldiers, strictly and accurately performing all tasks, observing laws, rules, instructions and personal safety measures! I wish you to fulfil high-level military duty and return home with honour and dignity,” said Yermekbayev addressing the peacekeepers.

    They will replace the first peacekeeping contingent deployed at the end of October. Prior to that, the peacekeepers trained in joint-military exercises with Indian battalion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). They are the first Kazakh armed forces sent with a UN peacekeeping mission.

    Indian Battalion (IND BATT), as a more experienced party in peacekeeping, leads the mixed forces of IND-KAZ BATT.

    \                                ______\n                            \n                         HON.
    ALCEE L. HASTINGS\n                               of florida\n                    in
    the house of representatives\n                      Wednesday, February 6, 2019\n\nMr.
    HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Nur Otan  party in Kazakhstan
    for its twentieth anniversary and the convening of its eighteenth Congress in
    Astana, Kazakhstan later this month. The Nur Otan party has made Kazakhstan's
    growth in the region, and around the world, its core mission through \"Kazakhstan
    2050.\"\n\nThis strategy seeks to place the country in the top 30 global economies
    by 2050 by investing in not only economic sectors; but through social initiatives
    as well. For instance, President Nazarbayev, Chairman of Nur Otan, has singled
    out investments in public housing, education, small business, economic diversification,
    and energy.\n\nMadam Speaker, we must encourage such development, but we must
    also never forget the role Kazakhstan has played in our fight against terrorism
    and the immense role the country has played in the global cause of non-proliferation.
    In Afghanistan, Kazakhstan has provided invaluable support for supply lines used
    by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Coalition, while also conducting
    joint military training programs with American and North Atlantic Treaty Organization
    (NATO) forces in the Central Asian steppes. As for non-proliferation, Kazakhstan,
    under President Nazarbayev's steady leadership, has not only relentlessly championed
    the cause of nuclear disarmament, but it has also established the world's first-ever
    Low Enriched Uranium Fuel Bank, in order to ensure stable civil nuclear energy
    use worldwide.\n\nMadam Speaker, it is abundantly clear that Kazakhstan has been,
    and continues to be, a strong partner of ours in Central Asia, and it is my hope
    that the U.S.-Kazakhstan relationship will continue to strengthen to the benefit
    of both countries."

    __Dear participants!__

    I am glad to welcome you at the regular meeting of the Astana Club!

    For the fourth time this unique dialogue platform has gathered around the table the world's leading experts, diplomats and politicians.

    Here, in the heart of Eurasia, we are discussing the most topical issues.

    This format is becoming highly in demand today.

    Our shared duty is to seek a way out of the destructive spiral of conflict that is intertwined into the global geo-economics and geopolitics.

    Therefore, I primarily want to focus on the key markers and risks of the new reality.

    __First.__ The growing confrontations between the major powers aggravate the instability of the current world order, making events less predictable.

    The so-called “post-bipolar” world order is finally receding into the past.

    We are witnessing the formation of the contours of a Greater Eurasia.

    The process is influenced by both the changing balance between global players and the growing competition between regional powers.

    They are still unable to overcome the fundamental differences regarding the main issue - the future format of the world order.

    __Second.__ The aggravation of geopolitical rivalry between Russia, the United States and China is taking place not only in the global context, but also in the perimeter of Greater Eurasia.

    Complex challenges have always existed in this strategic triangle.

    However, the level of their controllability has been sharply reduced in recent years.

    From now on, large-scale crises are possible like never before.

    The probability of incidents that could escalate into full-fledged conflicts increases significantly.

    It must be clear that misunderstandings and miscalculations in crisis situations can lead to military confrontation.

    __Third.__ Increased confrontation challenges the effectiveness of global development institutions and security in general.

    The current key trend is “shattering” of the foundations of strategic stability.

    The situation regarding the agreements on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles (INF) is becoming critical.

    The extension of the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms, which is valid until 2021, remains suspended.

    The collapse of the INF and the problems with the extension of the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms will essentially bring down the arms control system.

    Global powers may return to an arms race.

    __Fourth.__ Economic confrontations have escalated to a phase that many experts openly call trade wars.

    One of them is between the USA and China, which account for a third of the global economy, 20% of global exports, and more than a third of direct investment.

    This will decrease the growth of the world economy and, as a result, will lead to a deterioration of the situation in developing countries. Poverty and unemployment is a good foundation for terrorism, migration and separatism.

    This is exactly the situation in Afghanistan, where the ongoing war has led to such drastic consequences as drug trafficking, terrorism and extremism.

    __Fifth.__ The most essential problem of the Eurasian geo-economics is the economic sanctions imposed unilaterally by certain states, and used as a response to counter-sanctions.

    __Sixth.__ The probability of a full-scale military confrontation in some parts of Greater Eurasia remains high.

    One of the most “explosive” regions is the Middle East.

    The instability is caused by the crisis in Syria, the ongoing political tension in Iraq, the civil war in Libya, and internal development challenges in Arab countries.

    All these are exacerbated by the breakdown of the nuclear agreement with Iran, which was a challenge to achieve. The world community, including Kazakhstan, was conducting long-term work on this document. Our country has proved the whole world that the possession of nuclear weapons is not a panacea for ensuring security. Having renounced these weapons, Kazakhstan earned the trust of the international community.

    Next year, the tangle of unsolved problems may become even more complicated, returning the specter of a big war to the Middle East.

    __Seventh.__ Global security continues to be threatened by international terrorism and extremism.

    According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, there were approximately 10 thousand terrorist attacks in the world in 2017, killing more than 26 thousand people.

    __Eighth.__ 2018 has convincingly shown that cybersecurity is becoming a completely new dimension of global stability.

    The clash between the major powers is transferred to this space.

    In the coming years, the safety of nuclear and other strategic facilities that can be disrupted by cyber technology will be more relevant.

    __Ninth.__ Another important issue is the security of the communications we use.

    Countries are constrained by the factor of strong economic interdependence that has developed as a result of globalization.

    However, trade wars and sanctions will erode the value of this factor.

    Global uncertainty leads to a balance of countries on the cutting edge of a new “cold war”, the consequences of which will be absolutely disadvantageous for all.

    __Dear friends!__

    The world armed with nuclear weapons cannot afford a new bloody outcome, as well as building a new world order for the third time on the fragments of the “old world”.

    Because there will be nothing to build and no one left.

    It is necessary to prevent a new global catastrophe, which has already acquired quite clear outlines.

    The world community must unite to address common challenges.

    During the ASEM forum in Brussels, I spoke about the perils of this international situation, similar to the Caribbean crisis of the early 60s.

    Recently, in Paris, it was said that World War I and World War II began due to the lack of negotiations, the lack of a dialogue. My proposal was that the great powers, especially the United States, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China and the EU countries, should always take  great responsibility in addressing the issues of the international agenda through the prism of the future of humanity.

    My proposal: the United States - the Russian Federation - the People's Republic of China - the EU should find new formats of dialogue, if we are talking about the fate of our civilization. After the First World War, the powers created the League of Nations. Then, after the Second World War – the United Nations. It is obvious that to settle the arising confrontations is a difficult challenge. Nevertheless, I proposed  Astana as a platform for these four parties to discuss the problems in the sphere of economics, politics and security.

    __First.__ I consider it necessary to update the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.

    In this regard, I propose to hold a similar conference on security and cooperation in 2020 – dedicated to the 45th anniversary since the adoption of the strategic document.

    We understand that the process of concluding a new agreement will not be easy.

    Therefore, it is advisable to start preparing for the final negotiations in 2019. Since our country was the organizer of the only OSCE Summit at the beginning of the 21st century, Kazakhstan is ready to initiate an event of this format in the future.

    Of course, a lot will depend on the position of the great powers.

    In this regard, I would like to urge the big players to work together to conclude a new agreement.

    __Second.__ To ensure strategic security, the nuclear powers should build a dialogue of trust among themselves.

    It is necessary to enhance negotiations on the further reduction of nuclear arsenals and on the creation of nuclear-weapons-free zones. Many years ago, we adopted the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However, despite the Treaty, some states acquired nuclear weapons. The reason for this was the lack of sanctions, which are provided for in that Treaty.

    Kazakhstan, a country that voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons, as one of the leaders of the global anti-nuclear movement, once again calls on the international community to build a nuclear-weapons-free world. In 1991, in the era of the Soviet Union, I raised the question of closing the largest nuclear test site in Semipalatinsk, where nuclear tests had been secretly carried out for a long time. It was not an easy task - to force the Soviet leadership and the military-industrial sector to close the test site. Subsequently, the same decisions were made around the world in respect to similar test sites. This work has been ongoing. Former US President Barack Obama initiated a number of anti-nuclear meetings where Kazakhstan took an active part. At the 23rd session of the UN General Assembly, I also launched Manifesto “The World. The 21st century”.

    __Third.__ Trade wars cannot settle global trade imbalances.

    Solutions need to be developed at the negotiating table under the auspices of the World Trade Organization in a multilateral format.

    The Ministerial Meeting of this Organization will be held in Astana in 2020.

    We see a way out of the situation in the development of common fair rules for trade and investment cooperation.

    It requires unconditional recognition of intellectual property rights, development of transparent, flexible and effective technology transfer rules.

    In addition, the solution to the problem of trade wars must be sought in reforming the WTO.

    The agreements governing the activities of this Organization should include mechanisms that increase the price of non-compliance with the rules.

    __Fourth.__ Asia needs its own collective security organization.

    I think its establishment is only a matter of time.

    Kazakhstan's initiative –the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia – could be the foundation for the future Organization for Security and Cooperation in Asia. In cooperation with the OSCE, this Organization could contribute to the creation of a security zone throughout the Eurasian subcontinent.

    To bring this idea to reality, as a first step, I propose to hold a joint consultative meeting of the OSCE, CICA and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

    The secretariats of these forums could meet to reconcile positions. The official opinion of Kazakhstan will be communicated to all the mentioned organizations.

    __Fifth.__ It is advisable to hold in Astana a Eurasian conference on security. At the same time, holding such a meeting is of fundamental importance regardless of the venue.

    This can be done within the framework of the Astana Club. Its organization can use the experience of holding reputable forums, such as the Munich Security Conference.

    __Sixth.__ The international community needs to form a global strategy for cooperation in developing the information space.

    __Dear ladies and gentlemen!__

    The Eurasian space has always been the main stage of history.

    But only in the last few years the real outlines of Greater Eurasia have emerged for the first time.

    The basis for this is the effective interaction of the Eurasian Economic Union, the European Union and the “One Belt One Road” Project.
    Kazakhstan, by being part of a huge Eurasia, has always been in favor of an open dialogue and adopted a peacekeeping policy, making efforts to reconcile the conflicting parties, and often achieved success in this matter.

    Our historical mission is to connect worlds.

    This is also the meaning of holding the Astana club meetings.

    In the next few days we will probably hear new, innovative ideas for the further development of Eurasia for the benefit of all the countries of the continent.

    I hope that many of them will be perceived by politicians and governments as practical recommendations for action.

    In the current global world, there are no bilateral conflicts that only hurt its participants.

    By consolidating efforts, we can contribute to conflict resolution and increase the well-being of peoples not only on the Eurasian continent, but throughout the world. I believe that if we want to save the planet for future generations there is no other alternative.

    Thank you for your attention!

  body: "__Distinguished Chairman! Distinguished Summit Participants!__\n\nToday the
    number of conflicts is growing in different corners of the world,  due to sanctions
    and trade wars on the rise international politics have become tense.\n\nTherefore,
    we should use ASEM forum to effectively solve above mentioned issues.\n\nWe know
    from history that a pragmatic dialogue among super powers is the guarantee of
    global stability and security.\n\nRegretfully, the international community is
    falling short of such dialogue and mutual understanding.\n\nToday we are all witnessing
    an economic and political, military confrontation similar to the Cuban crisis
    of the  60s of the previous century.  Especially with NATO frontiers coming close
    to the Russian borders.  \n\nHow do we build the future together, how do we promote
    inclusive sustainable productivity without solving this issue?\n\nThat is why
    this summit should call upon major countries such as US, Russia, China, and EU
    to realize their responsibility to humankind and look for the path to resolve
    international confrontations.\n\nShould this not happen:\n\nFirstly, clashes and
    confrontation in Syria, Ukraine and other countries will escalate further;\n\nSecondly,
    the difficult problems such as WMD proliferation, transnational terrorism will
    not be solved;\n\nThirdly, the world economy will deteriorate, situation of poor
    countries would become harder, fear will be seeded.  \n\nEveryone is aware that
    national leaders before us have managed to find understanding after WWII, at the
    time of bloody wars and in combatting terrorism. \n\nThis is also the demand of
    this time.\n\nI call upon above mentioned countries leaders (US, Russia, China,
    EU) to get together to discuss these burning problems.  Perhaps a UN special session
    should be called for this matter.\n\nIf need be we stand prepared to offer Astana
    as a platform for such a meeting.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that Kazakhstan
    is ready to actively participate in a partnership of Asian and European nations
    to face global challenges!\n\nLocated between Asia and Europe we are a country
    that has built highways and railway terminals to promote trade, bring Europe and
    China closer.\n\nThank you for your attention! "

  body: "__By Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev__\n\nHumanity hoped that the
    21st century would herald a new era of global cooperation.\n\nThis, however, may
    turn out to be a mirage.\n\nOur world is once again in danger and the risks cannot
    be underestimated. \n\nThe threat is a deadly war on a global scale.\n\nOur civilization,
    by scholars’ estimates, has survived more than 15,000 wars, approximately three
    every year.\n\nHundreds of millions of people have died, cities and countries
    have been destroyed, cultures and civilizations have vanished.\n\nAt the dawn
    of the 21st century, stunning scientific discoveries are being made, and new technologies
    are being invented.\n\nThe world is at the verge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nMany
    horrific diseases are being successfully eradicated.\n\nBut the virus of war continues
    to poison the international situation.\n\nIt drives the military-industrial complex,
    which in some countries has become the most powerful sector of the economy.\n\nIt
    may even in the future infect the development of artificial intelligence.\n\nMilitarism
    has deeply penetrated our minds and behavior.  \n\nThere are more than one billion
    small firearms in the hands of people. Thousands of civilians die every day from
    their use.\n\nWe cannot exclude the risk that this military threat could become
    a tragic reality on a global scale.\n\nWe can see the signs of such a terrible
    outcome.\n\nIn international relations, the risk of conflict has increased.\n\nConflict
    has engulfed the historic battlegrounds of the two World Wars – Eastern Europe,
    the Middle East, and North Africa.\n\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
    Weapons is not fulfilling its purpose.\n\nNuclear weapons and the technology that
    produces them have spread all over the world due to double standards of the main
    powers.\n\nIt may be just a matter of time before they fall into the hands of
    terrorists.\n\nInternational terrorism has gained a more sinister character.\n\n
    It has moved from isolated acts in individual countries to a large scale terrorist
    aggression across Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nThe exodus of millions of refugees,
    the destruction of sites and historic monuments have become an everyday reality.\n\nEconomic
    sanctions and trade wars are commonplace.\n\nOur planet is now on the edge of
    a new Cold War which could have  devastating consequences for all humankind.\n\nThis
    threatens the achievements of the last four decades.  \n\nAs a result of successful
    negotiations, the nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia have been reduced
    substantially.\n\nFive nuclear powers have announced and kept a moratorium on
    nuclear weapons testing.\n\nThe process of forming regional security systems has
    accelerated.\n\nA unique and comprehensive security structure – the Organization
    of Security and Cooperation in Europe – was created on principles of mutual trust.\n\nCoordinated
    action between world powers and UN peacekeeping operations saw many conflicts
    ended.\n\nHowever, today we are witnessing the erosion of these international
    security achievements.\n\nThis is an increasing and serious concern for millions
    of people.\n\nHow will the world situation develop?\n\nCould the tensions between
    the leading world powers escalate into a new long-term confrontation? Which country
    could be the next victim of the so-called “proxy-wars” between the world and regional
    powers?\n\nWhich territory, flourishing for now, will be torn apart by tank tracks
    and explosive shells? In which cities will children die under heavy rocket fire?\n\nFrom
    where and where to will the refugees fleeing conflicts migrate next?\n\nMore than
    60 years ago two prominent scientists Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell presented
    their manifesto, in which they asked “a dreadful but an inescapable question:
    shall we put an end to the human race, or will mankind be able to renounce war?”\n\nThe
    most brilliant minds of the 20th century have warned the people that in a future
    world war nuclear weapons will inevitably be used leading to the destruction of
    all life on our planet.\n\nTheir demand that disputes between countries cannot
    and should not be resolved by military means remains hugely relevant in the 21st
    century.\n\nTo end all wars is the most challenging task for our civilization.\n\nBut
    there is no other reasonable alternative.\n\nThis task has to be treated by the
    world leaders as the highest priority on the global agenda.\n\nIn the 21st century
    humanity must take decisive steps towards demilitarization.\n\nWe won’t get another
    chance.\n\nIf this objective is not achieved, our planet will end as a graveyard
    of radioactive materials.\n\nOur planet is unique. We have no other home.\n\nIt
    is why we need a new comprehensive PROGRAM - “21st CENTURY: A WORLD WITHOUT WARS”.\n\nThrough
    this global strategy we need to identify joint and responsible actions to be taken
    by all nations in order to destroy the virus of war.\n\nThis document should be
    based on three main principles.\n\nFirst, there will be no winners in any modern
    war; everyone would be on the losing side.\n\nSecondly, a new war will inevitably
    entail the use of weapons of mass destruction.  \n\nThis will lead to the destruction
    of all humankind.\n\nIt will be too late to argue over who is responsible for
    this catastrophe.\n\nThis threat must be understood by all current and future
    national leaders and politicians.\n\nThirdly, the main tool for resolving all
    disputes between states should be peaceful dialogue and constructive negotiations
    on the basis of equal responsibility for peace and security, mutual respect and
    non-interference into domestic affairs\n\nTaking all of this into consideration,
    the world community must take comprehensive action towards these goals.\n\n__First__,
    there must be gradual progress to a world free of nuclear and other weapons of
    mass destruction.\n\nAn important step, to which Kazakhstan made a significant
    contribution, has already been taken in the right direction.\n\nOn December 7,
    2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration for the Achievement
    of a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World put forward by Kazakhstan.\n\n25 years ago Kazakhstan
    permanently closed the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site.\n\nWe were the first,
    and for now, only such country to take this action.\n\nOur newly independent state
    then voluntarily renounced the  world’s 4th largest arsenal of nuclear weapons
    - the menacing legacy of the collapsed Soviet Union.\n\nThese decisions triggered
    a moratorium on conducting nuclear tests by world nuclear powers.\n\nTwenty years
    ago, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was developed in the UN and was
    put forward to Member States to sign but has still to come into force.\n\nUnder
    the IAEA auspices, Kazakhstan is to host the Low-Enriched Uranium Bank on its
    territory, which will allow countries to develop civilian nuclear energy.\n\nGlobal
    nuclear security summits are of great importance.\n\nWe now need global decisions
    to prohibit deploying lethal weapons in outer space, on the seabed and in international
    waters of the World Ocean, as well as in the Arctic.\n\nWe should develop and
    adopt international binding agreements to ban the creation of new types of weapons
    of mass destruction through new scientific discoveries.\n\nIt is necessary to
    create a register in the UN of such scientific developments, which could be used
    for the creation and advancement of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n__Secondly__,
    we must build on and expand existing geographical initiatives to gradually eliminate
    war as a way of life.\n\nThere are already six nuclear weapon free zones in the
    world.\n\nThey encompass Antarctica, virtually the entire South Hemisphere, including
    Latin America, Africa, Australia, and Oceania.\n\nThe newest is a zone free of
    nuclear weapons in Central Asia created 10 years ago in Semipalatinsk by five
    states of the region.\n\nNow we must intensify international efforts to create
    a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1992, Kazakhstan put forward
    the initiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building
    Measures in Asia.\n\nThis century the forum has been successfully institutionalized
    with participation of 26 Member States of the continent, the United Nations and
    other international organizations.\n\nMultilateral cooperation among the People’s
    Republic of China, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
    and Uzbekistan within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s activities has had
    a positive impact.\n\nPeace zones in South America, South Atlantic and the Indian
    Ocean have significant potential.\n\nWe should bring together these initiatives
    to create global areas of peace based on a special international law.\n\nIssues
    of security and development in these Areas of Peace could be guaranteed by all
    the UN Member States as well as the UN Security Council.\n\n__Thirdly__, it is
    necessary to eliminate such relics of the Cold War as military blocs, which threaten
    global security and impede broader international cooperation.\n\nGeopolitical
    reality means that when one military bloc is established and developed an opposing
    bloc will be created.  \n\nPower generates anti-power.\n\nMilitary blocs can include
    countries which are not always aware of their responsibility to promote peace
    and security.\n\nWe have also seen attempts by some states to use the protection
    of military blocs to their advantage in their interactions with third countries,
    including immediate neighbors.\n\nIt is how confrontation can be infinitely cloned
    in different regions and globally.\n\nWe should also have learnt from past wars
    and conflicts that it is impossible to ensure our own security by undermining
    the security of others.\n\nThat is why a Global Coalition of States for peace,
    stability, trust and security under the UN auspices should be set up against military
    blocs.\n\nOur common task for the next decade should be to end wars and conflicts
    in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Syria, in eastern Ukraine and the Palestinian-Israeli
    confrontation.\n\nWe must reduce the dangerous potential of the situations on
    the Korean Peninsula, the basin of the South China Sea, and the Arctic.\n\n__Fourthly__,
    it is important to adapt the international disarmament process to the new historic
    conditions.\n\nA short-sighted dismantlement of previous treaty limitations on
    anti-missile systems and conventional arms has resulted in militarization in the
    political space of Eurasia.\n\nThis increases the risk of a new global war, even
    by the possible failure of electronic defense management systems.\n\nWe need a
    new strategy for the UN Conference on Disarmament.\n\nThe world needs to eliminate
    the new threat of cybercrime, which can become a very dangerous weapon if used
    by terrorists.\n\n__Fifthly__, a world without war requires primarily fair global
    competition in international trade, finance, and development.\n\nDuring the 70th
    session of the UN General Assembly, Kazakhstan proposed the development of a 2045
    Global Strategic Initiative Plan.\n\nIts main goal is to eliminate the root causes
    of wars and conflicts.\n\nThis can best be achieved by through equal and fair
    access to infrastructure, resources and markets for all nations.\n\nThe plan should
    be implemented in time for the 100th anniversary of the United Nations in 2045.\n\nKazakhstan
    proposes to convene a high level UN Conference in 2016.\n\nAt this conference
    we should confirm the basic principles of international law to prevent devastating
    wars and conflicts in the 21st century.\n\nCalls for reason and dialogue, restraint
    and common sense should not be the targets of attacks by those opposing global
    peace.\n\nIn the 21st century, we all need peace.\n\nThis is a key mission of
    our time.\n\nPeace is worth fighting for just as deliberately and persistently
    as did people in the past century.\n\nWe should think hard about the future of
    our children and grandchildren.\n\nWe must combine the efforts of governments,
    politicians, scientists, entrepreneurs, artists, and millions of people around
    the world in order to prevent a repetition of tragic mistakes of past centuries
    and  spare the world from the threat of a war.\n\nFailing to act or putting limits
    on efforts to promote peace risk global catastrophe.\n\nMy Manifesto “The World.
    The 21st Century” reflects a sincere concern for the fate of future generations,
    which will live and work in the coming decades.\n\nWe, the leaders of states and
    politicians, bear an enormous responsibility for the future of the humanity.\n\nAs
    an individual who went through hardship and difficulties, and as a statesman who
    made a difficult decision to close the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and renounce
    nuclear weapons, I urgently call on world leaders and the entire international
    community to listen to reason.\n\nWe need to do our utmost to free humanity from
    the threat of deadly wars forever.\n\nThere is no more important goal."

  - Ambassador's Opinion
  body: "__By Ambassador Erzhan Kazykhanov__\n\nTwenty years ago, few people in the
    United States would have been familiar with Astana. How could they be? The small,
    young city had just been named the capital of Kazakhstan, a newly independent
    country in Central Asia. \n\nBut in just two short decades, Astana has made a
    dramatic transformation. It has gone from being a relatively unknown capital to
    the current financial powerhouse of Central Asia. There is a common belief that
    economic gravity is shifting toward Asia, and as global dynamics shift, the launch
    of the Astana International Finance Center (AIFC) on July 5 — coinciding with
    Astana’s 20th anniversary on July 6 — is critical for the rapidly developing financial
    environment of the 21st century. With the United States striving to play a prominent
    role in the Asian financial system, Astana can serve as its bridge between Asia
    and Europe, the Middle East and the West. \n\nKazakhstan is devoting more than
    $60 million per year to develop the center through 2020, while we are aiming to
    attract up to $40 billion in investments by 2025. The financial free zone is the
    first major financial hub in Central Asia and throughout the entire Eurasian region,
    and because the United States is a strategic partner of Kazakhstan, American companies
    can play a key role in developing the center. NASDAQ technology, for instance,
    is powering the financial hub and has signed agreements to assist in the establishment
    of the Astana International Exchange (AIX). \n\nLike all businesses, American
    investors want to invest efficiently and in a country that is both stable and
    safe. In the past, it has been London, or Istanbul or Dubai. But in its short
    history, Astana has proven itself — through hosting international events and being
    dubbed the “City of Peace” by UNESCO — to be a trusted location for connecting
    financial regions and promoting business development and investment. \n\nKazakh
    President Nursultan Nazarbayev has ambitious plans for Astana as we work to develop
    our capital into a global financial hub. And our economic ties with the U.S. play
    an integral role in these plans. Earlier this year, President Nazarbayev was in
    Washington to meet with President Donald Trump and American business leaders to
    discuss the enhanced strategic partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan.
    We are also working to have Kazakhstan granted the status of permanent normal
    trade relation (PNTR), increasing free trade between our two nations and more
    importantly creating jobs in both countries. PNTR would be a significant step
    as we work toward creating integrated economies and aid the U.S. in its dealings
    with other economic zones, such as in China and Russia. \n\nWhile we are striving
    to turn AIFC into an integral center for the world economy, Astana has also become
    an essential avenue for tackling problems and defusing tensions. It is now a recognized
    and central venue for hosting international peace talks, including negotiations
    to end the Syrian civil war. \n\nThroughout the years it has hosted a number of
    historic events, including the 2010 OSCE Summit; the Organization for Islamic
    Cooperation Summit on Science & Technology; five Congresses of Leaders of World
    & Traditional Religions; the Inauguration of the 2013-2023 International Decade
    for the Rapprochement of Cultures; and several international forums for a nuclear
    weapons-free world. And last summer, Astana hosted EXPO 2017, which featured more
    than 100 participating countries and included a strong U.S. pavilion demonstrating
    America’s spirit of innovation. \n\nNot bad for a young capital. \n\nThe 20th
    anniversary of Astana is a huge and exciting moment in the history of my country.
    As our world moves further into the 21st century and our security challenges become
    a growing concern, we will continue to promote our shared goals: international
    peace, regional stability and economic prosperity. Our newly inaugurated financial
    zone is just the beginning — it lays the groundwork for new partnerships as we
    become an increasingly prominent stalwart of peace and progress in the region."

  - Ambassador's Opinion
  body: "__By Ambassador Erzhan Kazykhanov__\n\nSecurity and stability, while essential
    for global prosperity and well-being, have become increasingly endangered. Whether
    it is the re-emergence of the nuclear threat, violent conflict driven by extremism,
    the re-awakening of old tensions between countries or frequent humanitarian disasters,
    we seem further away from the peaceful, stable world we are all seeking to achieve.
    \n\nThis failure is a major concern to the United States and to countries, big
    and small, developed and developing, around the world. And that’s certainly the
    case for Kazakhstan, the largest, most prosperous and stable country in Central
    Asia.\n\nEqual in size to all of Western Europe, Kazakhstan serves as a bridge
    between east and west, north and south. This position means we have many practical
    reasons for working hard, with our partners, to tackle problems, defuse tensions
    and deliver security for countries and peoples.\n\nKazakhstan’s quarter centuries
    of bilateral relations with the United States has been positive and productive,
    forging a partnership that is making a difference across a range of issues. The
    U.S. was the first to recognize our independence in 1991. The U.S. played a key
    role, for example, in helping us voluntarily and safely give up the nuclear arsenal
    we inherited on the break-up of the Soviet Union. We, in turn, have strongly supported
    American-led stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nIt is a partnership which
    will be further strengthened when President Nazabayev visits Washington this week
    to meet President Trump. It is a timely meeting, too, as Kazakhstan is mid-way
    through a two-year position on the UN Security Council, which it chairs this month.\n\nAs
    the first country from Central Asia to be elected onto the Security Council, it
    is both an honor and a responsibility. It is also a reminder that Kazakhstan does
    not just have good relations with the US but also our neighbors Russia and China,
    with Europe which is our main market, as well as nations across the Middle East
    and Asia.\n\nThese friendships have enabled us to use our good offices to promote
    dialogue and co-operation regionally and globally. For example, Kazakhstan is
    increasingly playing a prominent role in fostering peace talks, including in the
    Middle East, hosting the Astana peace talks on Syria. Helping create the environment
    which will make greater co-operation possible is one of our top priorities for
    our time on the Security Council.\n\nWe are also committed on the UNSC to give
    a higher profile to the continuing plight of Afghanistan. It is easy to see why
    the Middle East and particularly the threat from Daesh or ISIS was rightly at
    the top of the international agenda. Their hate-filled beliefs not only cast a
    terrible shadow over the region but have also taken terrorism into the heart of
    cities across the world.\n\nIt would, however, be very short-sighted to forget
    Afghanistan and the importance of continuing to help bring peace and tackle poverty
    within its borders. Nor can we allow the sacrifice made by the United States and
    many other countries to be in vain, particularly as there are signs of progress.
    This requires an increased global effort to provide the Afghan government the
    help it needs to bring stability and opportunity across the country.\n\nThere
    is, I believe, a special responsibility on Afghanistan’s regional neighbors to
    increase their support. Kazakhstan is already providing bilateral assistance to
    help rebuild Afghanistan’s infrastructure, to train its police force and to educate
    its young people.\n\nWe are also determined to build a successful regional economy
    into which Afghanistan is fully integrated. Providing the engine to lift its people
    out of poverty is, in the end, the best hope for the country. \n\nWe are committed
    to continuing these efforts as we strive to play an ever increasing role in the
    global community. Kazakhstan will continue to act as a bridge between the East
    and West in an effort to promote a better understanding between all nations."

    Roosevelt Room

    12:25 P.M. EST

    __PRESIDENT TRUMP:__  Thank you.  And I’m pleased to welcome President Nazarbayev who has done a tremendous job in Kazakhstan.  And having you at the White House is an honor.  Mr. President, thank you for visiting with us, and we have very important discussions going on.

    For more than a quarter century, the United States has seen the strong, sovereign, and independent nation of Kazakhstan as a valued friend and a strategic partner in Central Asia.  And we’re honored, and we are truly honored to be the first country to recognize Kazakhstani independence on Christmas Day 1991.  That’s a long time ago, but not that long.  You’ve made incredible strides.

    Since that time, the United States and Kazakhstan have worked together to advance peace and security in the region and far beyond the region.

    Together, we dismantled Kazakhstan’s nuclear weapons infrastructure and ensured a safer and healthier future for the children of Kazakhstan and for the world at large.  We’ve pursued opportunities to increase investment in Kazakhstan and the energy sector in particular.

    And today, our strategic partnership with Kazakhstan has advanced my South Asia strategy, which is working, and working far more rapidly than anybody would understand, and providing crucial support for our forces in Afghanistan and denying safe haven for terrorists.

    This cooperation has grown even stronger this month during Kazakhstan’s presidency of the United Nations Security Council.  And I will say, that’s a great honor.

    Today, the President and I have a series of discussions on how our relationship can further the safety, prosperity, and wellbeing of our people.  Kazakhstan is a valued partner in our efforts to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.  Together, we are determined to prevent the North Korean regime from threatening the world with nuclear devastation.

    I also want to thank the President for his full support for our South Asia strategy, including our efforts in Afghanistan.  I greatly appreciate the President’s personal assurances that Kazakhstan will continue to provide critical logistical support and access for our troops fighting ISIS and the Taliban, where we have made tremendous strides.

    We also appreciate Kazakhstan’s work to train and educate Afghan civilian specialists, and I’m grateful for the President’s pledge of additional support to bolster Afghan security.  The United States seeks partners who are strong, prosperous, respectful of their neighbors, and in control of their own destinies.

    I’m pleased that the President has shared his plan for Kazakhstan to become a top 30 global economy by 2015, and he’s on his way — very rapidly.  He’s also working to improve Kazakhstan’s business environment, which will create new opportunities for American companies who are over there, and lots of jobs are being provided to both countries.

    American businesses are currently among the largest investors in Kazakhstan.  And tonight, the President will attend a roundtable with American business executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to further advance our commercial ties.

    We also agree that fair and reciprocal — such an important word, “reciprocal” — trade benefits both of our countries.

    I greatly appreciate Kazakhstan’s participation in our Central Asia Trade Forum and in our Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement.  The President and I are working together to bring high-quality U.S. products and services to the Kazakhstani people — so important.  And it’s really happening, and it’s happening rapidly all across a range of industries, including commercial aircraft, railways, medical services, technology, and energy.

    Working in common cause, we can advance greater opportunity for citizens in both of our countries.  Mr. President, thank you for visiting the White House today.  Our nations have a long history of cooperation to promote a safer, healthier, more prosperous, and brighter tomorrow.  I look forward to seeing the great advances of the Kazakhstani people under your incredible leadership.  And that’s what it is, it’s incredible leadership.

    We want a strong, sovereign, and thriving future for Kazakhstan and for the peace-loving nations of the world — all of them.  Thank you very much.  I very much appreciate it.

    __PRESIDENT NAZARBAYEV:__  (As interpreted.)  Distinguished Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation to visit your country.  I would like also to express my appreciation for warm hospitality.

    And our phone conversation was followed by our meeting in Riyadh, Saudi.  And today’s visit, this is all done in the atmosphere of friendship and trust, and I appreciate that.

    And I’m confident that as a result of my visit, the relations between our two countries would be elevated to the level of the enlarged strategic partnership that would work to the benefit of both nations.

    And today, we will adopt a political statement that says about this new level of relations, and that would signal the new era of the relations between Kazakhstan and United States, between Astana and Washington.

    And indeed, the United States was the first country to recognize our independence.  And since then, your country has supported Kazakhstan, which helped build and strengthen our nation and make it what it is today, as a fair player of the international community.

    And today, I’m representing Kazakhstan, the country that used to be a part of Soviet Union, and when the Soviet Union collapsed, this was not the most well-to-do former republic.  But I’m also here representing Central Asia, in the format of five Central Asian countries.

    And recently, Central Asia became into the focus of big global players, because we are bordering Russia on one side; on the other side, we have China; to the south, we have an Islamic world.  But we want also the United States to be present there in the format of Central Asia countries plus one — that’s means the United States.  And we would appreciate this new format of collaboration.

    From the very first days after 9/11, Kazakhstan very steadfastly supported the fight of the United States against terrorism, and now we continue to collaborate closely in Afghanistan with your country.

    While the American troops are in Afghanistan, I think it’s the mission of the whole world to make sure that Afghanistan is stabilized, and it’s also a mission for us, as a neighboring country of Afghanistan, to see that peace prevails in Afghanistan.

    Mr. President, so far, we provided some humanitarian and technical support to Afghanistan worth 75 million U.S dollars.  But on top of that, Kazakhstan government spent 50 million U.S. dollars training Afghanis in Kazakhstan to some civilian professions that they cannot get trained in Afghanistan.

    I think that later on, we will have an opportunity to discuss deeper the issue of Afghanistan.

    We spoke about other international issues, and we spoke about the North Korean issue.  And you probably know that Kazakhstan was a country that possessed the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world, but then we voluntarily decided to give up nuclear weapons, and we also shut down the nuclear test site in Semipalatinsk, the largest nuclear test site in the world.  And I think Kazakhstan has the moral right to talk to the nations that are seeking nuclear weapons.  And this is the way we’re talking to Iran, and this is the way we will be talking to North Korea.

    I think the issue of North Korea can be solved by joining efforts of United States, China, and Russia.  And Kazakhstan, being a neighbor of Russia physically, of course, is following very closely the dynamics between the U.S. and Russian relations, which suddenly plunged into the abyss.

    And in bilateral relations, I think economic relations play a key role.  And in Kazakhstan, we have major American companies operating for many years.  We have Chevron, ExxonMobil.  We have General Electric, Halliburton.  And all these companies invested about 50 billion U.S. dollars into Kazakhstani economy so far.  And also, that trade created additional 5,000 jobs in United States.

    And in the afternoon, we’ll have a roundtable where we will discuss the technical modernization of Kazakhstani economy, the new opportunities.  And during that roundtable, we’ll sign 20 commercial contracts that would sum up to 7.5 billion U.S. dollars.  And that’s a very strong sign of how vivid and robust our relations are.

    And the contracts would be about purchasing additional Boeing planes, passenger planes; about assembling 900 new General Electric locomotives in Kazakhstan; and also some contracts on collaboration in agriculture sector.

    And Kazakhstan declared a visa-free regime for American citizens visiting our country, and we hope and expect that there would be a reciprocity in American — (translation interrupted).  And we are working on opening a direct flight between our countries.

    Mr. President, allow me to conclude by congratulating you with a great economic success that your country is witnessing during your office.  You carried out an outstanding taxation reform.  And because I did something similar in my country five years ago, I fully support what you do there.  (Laughter.)  Our corporate tax is 20 percent; income tax is 10 percent for everyone.

    So this is the first anniversary of you in the office of the President.  Congratulations on that.  And, by the way, congratulations on the birth of your ninth grandchild.  But I’m a little bit ahead of you because last year I had a tenth grandchild in my family.  (Laughter.)

    __PRESIDENT TRUMP:__  That’s fantastic. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.

  - Prepared Remarks & Speeches
  body: "__Distinguished Secretary-General,__\n__Distinguished Council members,__\n__Ladies
    and gentlemen,__\nI am glad to welcome you at this thematic briefing. (in Kazakh)
    \n\nWe consider Kazakhstan’s election as a non-permanent member and today’s presidency
    in the UN Security Council as a sign of trust of the international community to
    our country and our peaceful policy. And I would like to thank those Member-states
    that supported us.\n\nAs the first state from Central Asia in this noble mission
    we have become the voice of the countries of our region in this important body
    of the global organization.\n\nA year has passed since Kazakhstan started its
    term in the UNSC.\n\nWe have strived to be proactive, constructive and objective
    in tackling pressing issues present on the Agenda of the Council.\n\nWhile chairing
    Committees on Afghanistan/Taliban, ISIL/DA’ESH, Al-Qaida and Somalia/Eritrea we
    have been making our contribution to their productive proceedings.\n\nI am grateful
    to all Council Members for their continued cooperation.\n\n*(In Russian)*\n\n__Distinguished
    Ladies and Gentlemen!__\n\nToday’s meeting is the flagship event of Kazakhstan’s
    presidency at the UNSC and is specifically dedicated to one of the most pressing
    topics on contemporary global agenda.\n\nConfidence-building measures aimed at
    achieving the goals of peace and security play key role in conflict prevention
    and resolution of pressing global issues.\n\nAt the 47th session of UN General
    Assembly I proposed to establish the regional structure for security and confidence-building
    measures in Asia (CICA).\n\nThis mechanism was created as a result of thorough
    diplomatic action.\n\nPresently the CICA is successfully functions bringing together
    26 states of the region.\n\nQuarter of a century later I speak again at the UN
    on behalf of Kazakhstan as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.\n\nI
    can’t help but state that cause of increasing mutual confidence among some countries,
    and at the global level remains acute and is becoming ever more relevant.\n\nConfidence-building
    measures should remain on the agenda as the most important element in the maintenance
    of global security architecture, enhancing peace at the global level.\n\nWhy so?\n\nFirstly,
    confidence-building measures have justified themselves in the process of preventing
    the threat of total destruction in the second half of the twenty-first century
    when humankind was at the brink of a large-scale war.\n\nThe UN Charter states
    that our main goal is to “save the succeeding generations from the scourge of
    war”.\n\nOver quarter of a century at the UN system my country has made a sweeping
    transition from an owner of the world’s fourth largest nuclear arsenal to a leader
    in global non-proliferation at the same time closing down the largest nuclear
    test site in Semipalatinsk as you are aware.\n\nRenunciation of nuclear weapons
    and the status of a nuclear power was our conscious and sincere choice, a voluntary
    act supported by all the people of Kazakhstan and duly appreciated by the international
    community.\n\nPresently, our country is a party to all fundamental international
    treaties in the arena of nuclear security and has regularized its nuclear free
    status.\n\nSecondly, the atmosphere of mutual trust may facilitate forming a new
    model of international cooperation.\n\nA shining example and a practical embodiment
    of such cooperation is the opening of the IAEA Low-Enriched Uranium Bank last
    year.\n\nWith this Kazakhstan has made yet another contribution towards strengthening
    the non-proliferation regime and safe use of uranium for peaceful uses.\n\nThirdly,
    nuclear free path of Kazakhstan may become an example and serve as a practical
    guidance to other countries. I am speaking from my own example.\n\nWe have both
    built and strengthened our independent country, achieved its high international
    standing by renouncing nuclear weapons and securing non-aggression safeguards
    from nuclear powers. We call upon all other countries to follow our example. We
    called upon Iran once, and now we call upon North Korea. Those nuclear bombs and
    rockets do not possess real power and they are abundant in the world. This does
    not provide true protection. Protection is provided through the trust of the international
    community.\n\nFourthly, current possibilities of progress in Science and Technology
    and realities of globalization make the task of WMD non-proliferation a matter
    of humanity’s survival.\n\nIncrease in the number of countries possessing WMD
    creates a risk of nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological weapons falling
    into the hands of destructive forces.\n\nThe present day legal framework failed
    to prevent the expansion of the “Nuclear Powers Club” in the late XX century.\n\nI
    believe that the so-much needed for strengthening of the non-proliferation regime
    based on Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) shall require
    deep mental changes, new multilateral political solutions.\n\nI would suggest
    the following measures to enhance confidence in the field of non-proliferation.\n\nFirst.
    I find it necessary to make withdrawal from NPT more difficult.\n\nThe example
    of North Korea may prompt to a similar action other countries with ambitions to
    possess nuclear weapons. We know how many states today possess threshold status.\n\nWithout
    doubting NPT, I suggest considering a possibility of crafting a special UNSC resolution
    setting forth implications for the countries in breach of the Treaty (including
    sanctions or other coercive measures). We can all see the necessity of it. The
    presence of international law agreements did not prevent some countries such as
    India and Pakistan from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n\nSecond. We should develop
    a truly effective mechanism of applying stringent measures against acquiring and
    proliferating WMD.\n\nSuch multilateral treaties shall be approved by certain
    UNSC resolutions.\n\nAs a main measure to remove incentives for possessing WMD,
    I believe it is necessary to develop a legally binding system of safeguards by
    nuclear powers to those states who would voluntarily renounce possessing nuclear
    weapons as well as to the states with non-nuclear status. This is fair and can
    be done without significant expenditures.\n\nThird. Success or failure of the
    process of modernization of the global security system directly depends on the
    ability of the international community to overcome militarist anachronisms.\n\nWe
    should leave behind division of countries into military blocks, whose existence
    becomes provocative and meaningless.\n\nThis is specifically where we need trust
    among states that is weakening with every passing year.\n\nI have put forward
    my vision of global anti-military measures last year in the Manifesto entitled
    “The World. Twenty-First Century” that proposes actions facilitating building
    a nuclear weapon free world by the UN Centenary. If the international community
    shall render its support and unity I believe that this goal is attainable.\n\nFourth.
    We should definitely bring political trust and a systemic dialogue back to the
    international affairs.\n\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) may serve
    as a good example. The Iran nuclear deal has demonstrated a possibility of a successful
    multilateral diplomacy in the sphere of non-proliferation.\n\nIt became a practical
    example in solving most complicated issues through negotiation.\n\nThis agreement
    became possible thanks to the atmosphere of trust establishing which is where
    Kazakhstan had made its contribution as well and by doing so gained the trust
    of the international community.\n\nI hope for further successful implementation
    of the JCPOA regardless of certain complications with fulfillment of their obligations
    by some of the parties to this Agreement. As you may know, two days ago I discussed
    this matter during my meeting with President D.Trump. I came to the understanding
    that we can surmount this issue.\n\nA similar constructive approach, in our opinion,
    may be applied in the matter of settlement of North Korea’s nuclear problem.\n\nIt
    is known, that current developments on the Korean Peninsula demonstrate deep contradictions.\n\nThe
    world is deeply concerned. This problem can be resolved by restoring trust among
    the United States, Russia and People’s Republic of China. This matter was discussed
    recently in the White House as well. I believe that our positions converged on
    this issue. Without the participation of the United States, Russia and China we
    will have difficulties in resolving this issue.\n\nIn this regard, we call upon
    the stakeholders to reach earliest and constructive settlement of the North Korean
    issue.\n\nWe stand for granting by “the Nuclear Five” security guarantees to the
    DPRK as an important condition for creating an atmosphere of trust for Pyongyang
    to return to the negotiations table.\n\nShould the need arise for the stakeholders
    Kazakhstan stands ready to provide a platform for negotiations.\n\nConfidence-building
    measures are also relevant as never before for the Middle East where dramatic
    events are unfolding today.\n\nThe conflict in Syria leads to negative implications
    far beyond the region.\n\nIt is noteworthy that mutual trust has become the basis
    for the Astana platform dialogue which is making its fair share of contribution
    to the process of Syria peace settlement, augmenting Geneva negotiations.\n\nSeven
    rounds of talks have taken place in Astana and according to the participants they
    were all successful and to a certain degree facilitated the solution to the issue.\n\nFifth.
    I believe that one of the most effective measures in combating the spread of WMD
    is the creation of nuclear free zones.\n\nThis constitutes a sign of collective
    trust. We have done so in Central Asia. I hope we will receive proper protection
    from the nuclear powers in exchange for such action.\n\nI find it important to
    continue the pursuit of creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East.\n\nI
    call upon stakeholders to resume the work and I hope that differences remaining
    among some countries will soon be surmounted.\n\nSixth. Today there is a risk
    of a new wave of arms race using scientific achievements.\n\nIn this regard the
    international community should strengthen control over the creation and proliferation
    of new military and information technologies.\n\nI believe that confidence-building
    measures are also needed in forging common approaches to prevention of militarization
    of outer space.\n\nAll those issues that I brought up earlier in my opinion merit
    for a dedicated UN meeting where we can discuss the emerging issues, converging
    the opinions and restoring trust among states.\n\n__Distinguished ladies and gentlemen!__\n\nToday’s
    realities are such that many conflicts may be prevented and effectively settled
    provided that mutual understanding and trust among the world’s nuclear powers
    is restored.\n\nThey bear the highest responsibility in the face of humanity to
    prevent a nuclear disaster. Largest nuclear powers particularly should be at the
    forefront of the struggle for the nuclear-free world, and show an example of WMD
    reduction.\n\nHowever it doesn’t mean that other countries shall stand on the
    sidelines, as if little depends on them. On the other side, if the great nuclear
    powers keep stating their intent to retain their nuclear status and modernize
    their weaponry whilst everyone else is banned from doing so, it will not work
    well. This is why I call to move in the right direction and cooperate.\n\nThe
    Global community is a single body, strong in its diversity and pluralism that
    can survive and strive when there is balance and harmony among nations and peoples
    living on this planet.\n\nHere is why we have to jointly strive for a safer world
    and equitable world order based on rule of international law.\n\nUndoubtedly,
    in this matter a special role and a historic mission lays with UN Security Council.\n\nI
    am convinced that in the twenty-first century humanity is capable of walking a
    dignified path to the world free from the threat of WMD.\n\nI believe that trust,
    willpower and intelligence of the global community multiplied by the energy of
    collective action will prevent our planet from stepping into the abyss of global
    catastrophe.\n\nThank you very much for your attention, distinguished ladies and
    gentlemen."

    A new programme of the Nur Otan Party until 2030 titled “The Society of Welfare 10 Goals of the Decade” was adopted. It contains specific goals and projects that should become the foundation of the state social policy for the next three years and set the tone for the whole decade.

    The main priority of the new party programme is to ensure a high standard of living for citizens and the development of Kazakhstan as a socially oriented state.
    The new programme will be implemented in three areas 1. Increasing income and supporting low-income segments of the population; 2. Addressing housing issues for citizens with low income and improving education and health care; 3. Integrated development of regions.
    The Head of State also stressed that this year more than 45% of all expenses of the state budget were allocated to the social sphere. Funds from the National Fund of Kazakhstan will also be allocated in order to improve the quality of life and well-being of Kazakh citizens.

    Based on this, President Nazarbayev set the following tasks before the Government of Kazakhstan
    - to raise wages of low-paid public sector employees up to 30%;
    - to raise the salary by an average of 25% for local workers of executive bodies who work directly with citizens at the district and regional levels.
    - in order to expand the coverage of low-income families, especially those with many children, to increase the criterion for providing targeted assistance to 70% of the subsistence minimum;
    - all procedures of social assistance assignment should be as simple as possible and turned into a proactive format;
    - to increase the allowance to parents, guardians and families (persons) raising children with disabilities by 30%;
    - to build more than 40,000 apartments for rent within the Nurly Zher programme, mainly for low-income families with many children;
    - to develop a preferential mechanism for the provision of housing loans at 2-3% per annum through the system of housing savings.
    - to increase the expenditure on the public health service and primary health care from 40 to 60% of the total health care funding.
    > As noted by the Head of State, “today, the competition of states is about the competition of people. Economic achievements and geopolitical victories are not of great value unless they lead to an increase in each person’s welfare. This is the main secret of prosperity and the formula for the sustainable development of states in the 21st century.”

    __Dear people of Kazakhstan, compatriots, comrades, members of the Nur Otan party!__

    Today I am addressing you, as I have always done, at the most important moments of the history of our state, which we are building together.

    But today’s address is special.

    I have made a difficult decision for myself - to resign from the powers of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

    This year marks the 30th anniversary of my time as the leader of our country. I was honored by my people to become the First President of an independent Kazakhstan.

    Let us recall how the Soviet empire fell, leaving us with confusion and emotional turmoil, a ruined economy and politics.

    Gross domestic product halved, not enough food and essential goods were available. Overnight, all the major factories stopped operating. It seemed that things were about to collapse.

    It was a challenge. And we accepted it. We began to vigorously pave the Kazakhstan’s path of development.

    Our first task was to build a market economy, dismantle the totalitarian system of ideology and modernise all the institutions of society. And we did this in the name of creating a modern democratic state - the Republic of Kazakhstan.

    Understanding that it was impossible to build democratic institutions with a weak economy and poor citizens, we put economic development and the growth of citizens’ welfare at the forefront. As a result, we managed to increase the economy 15-fold and the income of the population 9-fold (in dollar terms), which made it possible to reduce the level of poverty by almost 10-fold.

    We have independently and successfully overcome the many challenges that we faced, including the deepest global financial crisis of 2007-2012.

    Kazakhstan has moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial service economy. A process of industrialisation and urbanisation of the country is in place. The world’s leading investors now participate in the commodity sector. This made it possible to implement many complex projects in the oil and gas sector.

    A fund for future generations of the people of Kazakhstan was established thanks to raw materials. Kazakhstan has become part of the global economy, attracting investment and trading with almost all countries of the world.

    A new infrastructure framework of the country has been established. All regions of the country are connected by road and rail. And aviation routes give us the opportunity to discover new places in the world.

    Kazakhstan became a large state not only by territory. Today we have more than 18 million people. The next target is not far away - 20 million people.

    We are among the top 50 most developed countries of the world. The development programme until 2050 has been established. The goal is to become one of the top 30 most developed countries by this time.

    We managed to build a successful Kazakhstan state with a modern market economy on the ruins of the Soviet Union, create peace and stability within a multi-ethnic and multi-religious Kazakhstan. For the first time in our centuries-old history, international legal recognition of the Republic of Kazakhstan has been secured. Kazakhstan has been put on the world map, where it did not exist as a state. We have our own flag, anthem, coat of arms.

    In the most difficult period of the 1990s, we began training specialists under the Bolashak programme in order to give young people a decent education, an opportunity to study global practices and benefit the country.

    There was a crisis in the world, but we established a world-class university in Astana, built intellectual schools. Young people who grew up during the years of independence, I am sure, appreciate the care that the country gave them. They are the fledglings of the independent Kazakhstan, who, I believe, will protect and strengthen our country, give their knowledge and strength to the cause of prosperity of the Homeland.

    For the first time in the history of the country, we built our capital. Astana is a tangible personification of all our achievements and victories.

    __We did all of this together, my dear people of Kazakhstan.__

    All these years you have supported me in all the elections, supported my initiatives. I was honored to serve my great nation, my native country. Thank you so much - to my people, I bow to you. Thanks to this support, I worked sparing no strength, energy, health and time to justify this trust.

    As you know, our laws give me the status of the First President - Elbasy (Leader of the Nation). I remain the Chairman of the Security Council, which is vested with serious powers. I remain the Chairman of the Nur Otan party, a member of the Constitutional Council. That is to say, I am staying with you. The concerns of the country and the people remain my concerns.

    As the founder of an independent Kazakhstan, I see my future task in ensuring the coming to power of a new generation of leaders who will continue the transformation being carried out in the country.

    The issue of continuity of power in Kazakhstan is resolved constitutionally. In the event of early termination of the powers of the current President, the powers are transferred to the Chairman of the Senate before the end of the electoral term. Then, elections of the new President will take place.

    The Chairman of the Senate of Parliament is currently Kassym-Jomart Kemelovich Tokayev. You know him well. He is a graduate of MGIMO. Fluent in English and Chinese. He has come a long way in the leadership positions of the Republic. He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the years of the formation of the country’s foreign policy, he worked as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of the country, the Chairperson of the Senate. He knows the country, its economy and politics. He was nominated and worked as the Deputy Secretary-General of the UN. This was a great recognition of his merits as a diplomat and a sign of confidence in Kazakhstan.

    Alongside me, he has been working since the first days of independence of Kazakhstan. I know him well. He is an honest, responsible and indispensable person. He supports a fully implemented policy inside and outside the country. All programmes were developed and adopted with his participation.

    I believe that Tokayev is the person we can entrust the governance of Kazakhstan.

    __Dear compatriots!__

    We see that the world is changing, not standing still. Not only are new opportunities arising, but also new global technological and demographic challenges are growing, and instability of the world order remains. Each generation has to solve their problems. I, and my generation did everything we could for the country. You know the results. The world is changing, and new generations are coming. The process is natural. They will solve the problems of their time. Let them try to make the country even better.

    We must change too, together with the world. I appeal to the young generation of the people of Kazakhstan - take care of the independent Kazakhstan - our common homeland, the Eternal Nation - this is our people, the land of our great ancestors. We have one homeland, one land.

    Take care of the friendship and unity of our people, our mutual trust and respect for the culture and traditions of every citizen of the country.

    Only in this way will we be strong, and overcome all the challenges.

    Only in this way will we flourish.


    __Dear people of Kazakhstan!__

    __My compatriots!__

    Today I appeal to each one of you.

    The country faces large-scale tasks. And I am confident in our success.

    How do I see Kazakhstan of the future?

    I firmly believe that the people of Kazakhstan of the future are a society of educated, free people who speak three languages.

    They are the citizens of the world. They travel. They are open to new knowledge. They are hardworking. They are patriots of their country.

    I am convinced that the future Kazakhstan is the Universal Labour Society. This is a state with a strong economy, where everything is done for the people. Where there is the best education, the best healthcare. Where peace and tranquility reign. Where citizens are free and equal, and power is fair. Where there is the rule of law.

    I believe that we are on the right path, and nothing can lead us astray.

    If we are strong, we will be well-regarded.

    If we hope for a miracle or rely on others, we will lose what we have achieved.

    AMMAN, 6 April 2019 – The 10th Regional Forum of the World Economic Forum (WEF) on the Middle East and North Africa “Building New Platforms of Cooperation" was held at the Dead Sea. Kazakhstan's delegation, led by Foreign Minister Beibut Atamkulov, took part in the Forum.

    The programme of the event included such issues as the fourth industrial revolution in the Arab world, developing a new economic model, a guide for addressing the common challenges facing the region, searching for common ground in a multi-conceptual world, and the future of industry dialogues.

    The forum was organised with the support and participation of King Abdullah II of Jordan. The event brought together over a thousand government, business and community leaders to create new mechanisms for dialogue and joint action during a period of profound economic, social and geopolitical changes in the region and around the world. The WEF, as an international organisation for public-private partnership, brought together major global companies, governments and civil society to develop cooperation between the public and private sectors on critical issues for the future of the region.

    On the sidelines of the forum, the Kazakh Foreign Minister held a number of meetings, where he discussed relevant issues of cooperation with both foreign countries and international businesses.

    The outcome of the 15-year partnership of Kazakhstan with this global expert organisation was discussed with Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF. It is often the case that ideas originating at the WEF discussion platforms become the basis of important international decisions. During the conversation, particular emphasis was placed on plans to expand interaction between Kazakhstan and the WEF.

    At the meeting of Mr. Atamkulov with the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Suma Chakrabarti, the sides discussed major events in Kazakhstan involving the bank, particularly the session of the Foreign Investors' Council under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan (FIC) and the Astana Economic Forum.

    Having analysed their interaction with Kazakhstan, the sides agreed that the EBRD was an example of successful cooperation. To date, there are approximately 250 projects worth over $8 billion with the bank's participation in various sectors of Kazakhstan's economy.

    At the meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan, the Kazakh Foreign Minister informed the King of important developments in the internal political life of Kazakhstan, highlighting the continuity and stability of the country's foreign policy in accordance with the policy of First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan – Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev.

    The meeting highlighted the cordial relations between the First President of Kazakhstan and King Abdullah II, which became a solid basis for expanding cooperation across various areas. An agreement was reached on the further expansion of bilateral dialogue in such new areas as space industry and cyber security.

    Gratitude was expressed to the Jordanian side for supporting Kazakhstan's initiatives, namely, on inter-religious dialogue and ethnic and religious tolerance, as well as for the active participation of the King in the congresses of world and traditional religions.

    The Jordanian monarch expressed gratitude to the First President for supporting the initiative to hold the Astana talks on Syria, where Jordan participates as an observer, which significantly reduced violence in the country and created the necessary conditions for establishing the peace process.

    On the margins of the forum, meetings were also held with the President of Armenia Armen Sargsyan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkevics, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jordan Ayman Al Safadi, who discussed the current state and expansion of cooperation of Kazakhstan with these countries.

    Moreover, on the sidelines of the forum, meetings were held with major international companies in the Middle East (covering Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait) representing such sectors as retail, finance, agriculture, IT, mining and metallurgy, logistics and renewable energy. Following the meetings, the companies showed interest in joint projects and are expected to visit Kazakhstan in the near future to discuss specific plans.

    During the meeting, Nursultan Nazarbayev was informed about the current activities and future plans of the Foreign Ministry.

    The First President of Kazakhstan underlined the importance of the continuity of the country's foreign policy and the gradual implementation of measures to strengthen cooperation with the strategic partners of Kazakhstan.

    “There have been very serious political changes in Kazakhstan. We have showed the world that we are acting within the framework of the Constitution, ensuring a calm and peaceful transition of power. This event has become a milestone across-the-board. Now the main thing is the stability of the foreign policy that has been worked out earlier. First of all, attention should be paid to relations with our closest neighbors. They must remain trustful", Nursultan Nazarbayev said.

    The First President also noted the need for thorough preparation for the upcoming foreign visits and international events.

    “The following issues should be addressed. The first is the visit of the President of South Korea to Kazakhstan. The second is the trip to the People's Republic of China to participate in the Belt and Road Forum. Additionally, it is important to ensure the proper preparation of the fifth Eurasian Economic Union anniversary summit, which will be celebrated in our capital", Nursultan Nazarbayev stated.

    In turn, the Foreign Minister stressed that the leaders of international organizations praised the political events in Kazakhstan.

    “All the heads of international organizations express confidence that Kazakhstan will continue to implement its international obligations. The world community highly appreciates your global initiatives and contribution to ensuring security, primarily in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation", Mr. Atamkulov said.

    __Dear compatriots!__

    I appeal to each of you.

    In accordance with the Constitution, I have decided to hold early elections of the President of Kazakhstan on __June 9, 2019__.

    I consulted with Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev, as well as with Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, and the Prime Minister.

    The decision was agreed upon by the Constitutional Council.

    I met with the leaders of the parliamentary parties.

    __The decision on early elections is important and necessary.__

    Thanks to Elbasy, we have built a successful and widely respected nation. Kazakhstan has gained a worthy place in the international community. Our country plays an increasing role in global affairs.

    This is a fateful moment for all of us.

    The power in Kazakhstan has been transferred in a calm atmosphere in full accordance with the Constitution. This caused respect for Kazakhstan from the world community.

    Since taking office, I made a trip across regions, so I am aware of the mood of people. I meet with the intelligentsia, labour communities, business people, investors and representatives of international organizations.

    My conclusion is that we are on the right track. Our wise nation is united. Our state, as the supreme value of our independence, is indispensable.

    Therefore, I firmly believe that early elections of the Head of State are a vital necessity.

    In order to ensure political and social consent, confidently move forward, solve the tasks of socio-economic development, it is of vital importance to remove any uncertainty.

    Moreover, the situation in the world is changing rapidly and unfortunately, we are facing new challenges ahead. We must confirm the continuity, predictability and stability of our domestic and foreign policy. We shall continue working on the effective, successful implementation of social programs and strategic course ofElbasy.

    This can be fulfilled only through direct expression of the will of the people in the elections.

    Kazakhstan is a democratic state. And its President will be elected as per people's will.

    In the capacity of Acting Head of State, I guarantee that it will be free, transparent and fair elections!

    __This is my firm position!__

    We are facing great challenges. I believe in the wisdom of our people.

    __Dear compatriots!__

    The folk wisdom says, "Where there is unity, there is creation" (Birlik Bar Zherde, Tirlik Bar!).

    I am calling you to be fully responsible about the future elections.

    The future of our country and the destiny of each family depend on your decision!

    ##### An Interview with His Excellency Erzhan Kazykhanov, Ambassador of Kazakhstan to the United States

    EDITORS’ NOTE

    *His Excellency Erzhan Kazykhanov presented his credentials to become Ambassador of Kazakhstan to the United States in April 2017. He previously served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. Ambassador Kazykhanov has also held various government positions in Kazakhstan including assistant to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He served as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Ambassador of Kazakhstan to Austria; Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the international organizations in Vienna; and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York. Ambassador Kazykhanov earned his bachelor’s degree in Oriental studies from the Saint Petersburg State University in Russia and a Ph.D. in history from Al-Farabi Kazakh National University. He speaks Russian, English and Arabic and has authored numerous articles on diplomacy and Kazakhstan’s foreign policy issues.*

    #### What is the current state of Kazakhstan’s economy?

    Kazakhstan has the strongest economy in Central Asia, earning a spot among the top 30 countries of the World Bank’s “Doing Business 2019’’ report. With an abundance of natural resources and a unique geographical location as a bridge between the East and West, Kazakhstan has become a beacon of economic growth and an attractive destination for trade and foreign investment.

    As the country continues to diversify its economy, the Government of Kazakhstan has adopted numerous business-friendly policies to attract more investment into the country, including exemption from the value-added tax, corporate income tax, property tax, and land tax, as well as exemption from customs duties. Additionally, Kazakhstan has developed critical transportation infrastructure to facilitate trade across the whole of Eurasia.

    In 2018, Kazakhstan launched the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) as we aim to become a major financial hub in the region. Partnering with American companies like Nasdaq, AIFC serves as a trading and financing platform for foreign and domestic investors.

    Kazakhstan’s economic reforms have paved the way for international investments. The U.S., for example, has traditionally been the biggest investor in Kazakhstan with total investments exceeding $45 billion and more than 700 American companies are operating in Kazakhstan.

    #### Will you discuss the policies and reforms being enacted by the government of Kazakhstan?

    Kazakhstan’s economic success is the result of numerous reforms and business-friendly policies. Kazakhstan is constantly working to improve its policies in order to create an economic environment that is attractive to foreign investment. These efforts largely began with the 100 concrete steps launched in May 2015 at the Astana Economic Forum, and are categorized into five areas of institutional reforms: the formation of a professional state apparatus, advancement of the rule of law, industrialization and economic growth, enhanced identity and unity, and the formation of accountable government.

    Through these institutional reforms, Kazakhstan has positioned itself as a regional hub for trade. Because of its location in the center of the land trade “bridge” between Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan has access to the largest sales markets – the Eurasian Economic Union, Russia, China and Central Asia.

    #### Kazakhstan has placed a major emphasis on economic diplomacy. What makes this so critical and will you highlight these efforts?

    In today’s highly competitive global environment, economic and trade ties are an increasingly important part of international diplomacy. Official government visits focus not only on international political issues, but also on the development of closer economic ties. Diplomatic posts around the world not only work on political and consular issues, but increasingly engage with foreign investors, businesses and trade partners.

    Each year the foreign ministry and its diplomats help to organize more than 300 trade, economic and investment events and approximately 600 foreign delegation visits to Kazakhstan. Such engagements facilitate an increase in foreign direct investment.

    Kazakhstan has attracted more than $300 billion dollars in FDI since gaining its independence, making the country the leading investment destination in Central Asia. In the last two years alone, foreign companies have invested over $20 billion annually in Kazakhstan’s economy. Kazakhstan continues to adapt to new global realities to stay competitive in attracting high-quality investments.

    As we seek to further modernize our economy in order to reach our goal of joining the top 30 most developed countries by 2050, we are looking to strengthen our efforts in attracting a diversified range of foreign investments and technologies.

    #### How critical is the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral relationship and will you discuss the state of this relationship today?

    Since the founding of our country, the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral relationship has been of the utmost importance to Kazakhstan. The U.S. was the first country to recognize Kazakhstan’s independence and establish diplomatic ties 27 years ago. Since then, the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral relationship has grown substantially. President Nursultan Nazarbayev made an official visit to Washington, D.C., last year to meet President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence along with a number of business leaders. These meetings further cemented our countries’ mutual commitment to expand cooperation in many areas of shared interest, such as defense, trade, investment and energy.

    In the past nine months alone, both countries engaged in an unprecedented number of highly successful bilateral visits and business meetings in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, education, trade, culture and science. Last year U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross led one of the largest certified trade missions to Kazakhstan. This year we are expanding our presence in the United States by opening Kazakhstan’s Consulate General in San Francisco to boost cooperation with technology startups and foster innovation in tech policy.

    #### What are your key priorities in your role as Ambassador of Kazakhstan to the United States?

    Most of my time goes to enhancing trade and commercial ties between our countries. I constantly work to strengthen economic ties and seek new commercial opportunities. In order to promote mutually beneficial cooperation, it is necessary to understand your country’s needs while also being able to adjust to the interests of a host country.

    I work to ensure that Kazakhstan continues to provide quality products and services to the U.S. markets. We are currently exploring trade and investment opportunities in various areas such as IT, finance, metals, oil, gas and agriculture.

    In September 2018, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan visited Washington and the Midwest. We discussed the advancement of cooperation with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and American agricultural companies interested in entering the Kazakh market. With 24 million hectares of arable land, 188 million hectares of pasture and close proximity to the Russian, Central Asian and Chinese markets, Kazakhstan’s agricultural market has enormous untapped potential. As a practical step to help American businesses visit Kazakhstan, we established a visa-free system, opened the Consulate General in San Francisco and signed an Open Sky Agreement to enable direct flights between our countries.

    House on January 16, 2018.  The visit reinforced the close commercial and trade
    ties between the United States and Kazakhstan that will create jobs and accelerate
    economic growth in both countries.  President Nazarbayev proclaimed that these
    efforts are essential for Kazakhstan to achieve its goal of joining the ranks

    Airlines, and the Samruk-Kazyna National Wealth Fund for the purchase of U.S.
    products and services valued at over $2.5 billion.\n\nHighlights of this economic
    cooperation include:\n\n Regional Trade and Economic Development\n\nGovernment
    Cooperation. The United States and Kazakhstan continue to collaborate on implementing
    WTO obligations, resolving outstanding disputes, improving the Kazakhstani investment
    climate, and promoting greater bilateral investment. The two countries recently
    concluded an air navigation agreement, which will strengthen bilateral ties by
    easing the travel of senior officials between the United States and Kazakhstan.\n\n

    the framework of the Central Asia Trade and Investment Facilitation Agreement,
    which promotes increased trade within the region.\n\nKazakhstan demonstrated leadership

    leading to over $25 million in signed letters of intent to conduct future trade
    deals.\nBilateral Trade. Bilateral trade in goods grew to $1.9 billion in 2016,
    and both countries remain committed to further expanding the trade relationship.
    \ The United States welcomes Kazakhstan’s interest in pursuing a bilateral civil

    business links by encouraging affordable, convenient, and efficient services to
    air travelers.\n\nTrade in Commercial Aircraft.  During their visit, the two leaders
    celebrated two separate deals between Boeing and Kazakh airlines totaling over
    $1.3 billion, sustaining an estimated 7,100 direct and indirect U.S. jobs. Specifically,

    scheduled for delivery in March 2018, these will be the first 737 MAXs owned and
    operated in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, bolstering SCAT’s regional and international
    network.  Additionally, Air Astana, the national flag carrier of Kazakhstan, affirmed
    its commitment, under the terms of an existing contract, to purchase three 787
    Dreamliners, which are scheduled for delivery in 2021.\n\nRailways.  General Electric
    and Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) concluded two new strategic initiatives valued
    at over $900 million, which will sustain or create over 3,500 U.S. jobs.  GE Transportation
    will design and manufacture up to 300 shunter locomotives for KTZ, with delivery
    beginning in 2019.  GE Transportation also signed an 18-year service agreement
    to maintain and support 175 current KTZ GE Evo locomotives beginning in 2018.
    The deal will include an expansion of the main KTZ rail facility in Astana.\n\nAgriculture.

    will continue to seek opportunities for cooperation, including through collaborative
    agricultural research.  Joint work on research helps both countries work toward
    a safe and abundant food supply.\n\nAfghanistan Development. The United States

    political support, increased regional trade, and economic development.  Kazakhstan

    offered to continue training specialists in Kazakhstani institutions.\n\nDigital
    Infrastructure.  GE Digital and Kazakhstan’s Samruk-Kazyna National Wealth Fund
    signed a strategic partnership agreement aimed at accelerating the digital evolution
    of the Fund’s portfolio of industrial companies. The agreement demonstrates the
    companies’ progress in creating a sustainable digital ecosystem in Kazakhstan,
    and provides for the joint assessment of GE digital solutions based on the Predix
    platform.\n\n Leadership in Space Exploration. The United States appreciates that
    Kazakhstan is the point of departure and safe return for American astronauts traveling
    to and from the International Space Station. The United States encourages Kazakhstan’s
    participation in the 2nd International Space Exploration Forum on March 3 in Japan.
    \ Kazakhstan and the United States will explore cooperation in the application
    of space technologies to assess environmental and natural hazards within the framework
    of the International Charter, which aims to provide a unified system of space
    data acquisition and delivery to countries affected by natural or man-made disasters.\n\n
    Healthcare.  The United States and Kazakhstan are improving health care services
    in Kazakhstan through cooperation with the United States Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is also working with
    Nazarbayev University to establish a world-class oncology center, which will serve
    the citizens of Kazakhstan and all of Central Asia.\n\nPharmaceuticals.  Pfizer
    signed a memorandum of understanding with Kazakhstan to explore a localization
    project for the secondary packaging of a high-technology medical product. If concluded,
    the project could include measures to improve the cold chain system for the transportation
    and storage of medicines in Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan and Future Energy\n\nWorld
    Expo 2017.  Kazakhstan hosted the 2017 Expo in Astana, highlighting leadership
    in energy innovation under the slogan “Future Energy.”  The Expo grounds will
    be the future site of the Astana International Financial Center and a technology
    innovation park.\n\nStrategic Energy Dialogue.  In 2017, the United States and
    Kazakhstan elevated the previous bilateral Energy Partnership to the level of
    a Strategic Energy Dialogue, which will begin technical discussions in 2018.  This
    enhanced format provides a framework for cooperation on civilian nuclear development,
    carbon capture utilization and storage, grid resiliency, and nuclear security
    and non-proliferation.\n\nOil and Gas Exports and Investment.  Chevron and ExxonMobil
    entered the Kazakhstani market in 1993, becoming the first major oil companies
    to invest in the newly-independent country.\n\nChevron signed a landmark 40-year
    deal to develop the super-giant Tengiz field, and in the years since, Chevron
    has invested tens of billions of dollars in Kazakhstan to produce oil and gas,
    creating thousands of jobs and bringing world-class technology and expertise to
    the country’s energy sector.\nChevron signed a Memorandum of Understanding with
    the Kazakhstani Ministry of Energy to use $251 million of reinvestment funds to
    finance profitable projects in Kazakhstan.\nWith total investments surpassing
    $20.2 billion, ExxonMobil is active in the exploration, development, production,
    and transportation of oil and gas.\nTengizChevrOil (TCO), a joint venture with
    KazMunaiGaz, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and LukArco, has made direct financial payments
    of over $124 billion to Kazakhstani entities, and is currently implementing a
    $36.8 billion expansion project.\nThe North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement
    (NCSPSA) project is Kazakhstan’s largest direct foreign investment project, creating
    local jobs and business opportunities. The Kashagan Phase 1 project cost approximately
    $55 billion, with local content in goods, works, and services valued at more than
    $13.3 billion since 2004. The project will produce for decades and its shareholders,
    including ExxonMobil, expect to contribute billions of dollars in direct revenue
    to the Kazakhstani government.\nChevron and ExxonMobil have contributed to the
    development of Kazakhstan’s economy through participation in the Caspian Pipeline
    Consortium (CPC). In 2017, the CPC completed the Kazakhstani portion of an expansion
    project that could increase total throughput capacity to 1.4 million barrels per
    day.\nThe pipeline system represents the most attractive export option for Kazakhstani
    crude oil from the Tengiz and Kashagan fields.\n \nNuclear Power. The United States
    and Kazakhstan are committed to cooperation advancing safe nuclear power.\n\nKazakhstan
    is a leading uranium supplier, producing over 24,000 tons of nuclear fuel in 2016.\nIn
    2017, Kazakhstan opened the Low Enriched Uranium Bank in partnership with the
    United States. The LEU Bank provides a reliable source of fuel for countries transitioning
    to clean nuclear power and reduces the proliferation risk of enrichment technologies.\n
    Regional Grid Modernization. The United States and Kazakhstan agreed to explore
    technologies and projects to re-integrate the Central Asian regional power grid
    and enhance energy security, improve economic stability, and facilitate commercial
    investment.\n\nPower the Future – a regional effort within the framework of the
    2015 “Joint Declaration of Partnership by the Five Countries of Central Asia and
    the United States of America” (C5+1) — helps support the region’s transition to
    low emission, climate resilient economies.\nThe Power the Future program supports
    renewable energy projects that increase energy efficiency in Kazakhstan, while
    improving the ability to develop and achieve goals for the reduction of greenhouse
    gas emissions.\nEnhancing Human Capital\n\nVisa Program. In 2015, Kazakhstan initiated
    a short-term visa-free entry program for U.S. citizens, and the United States
    began issuing 10-year business and tourist visas to Kazakhstani citizens.  These
    visa regimes have facilitated travel to both countries, opening new opportunities
    for business, investment, and tourism.\n\nTravel.  Today, nearly 26,000 Kazakhstani
    citizens reside in the United States and over 5,000 U.S. citizens live in Kazakhstan.
    Last year, the United States Government issued nearly 18,000 visas to Kazakhstani
    citizens, and facilitated many visits to the United States.\n\nEducation.  The
    United States committed to assist the Government of Kazakhstan achieve its goal
    to establish a tri-lingual society by 2050.  The United States will resource development
    programs to improve access to English language education and train the next generation
    of English language educators in Kazakhstan.  In 2017, over 2,800 Kazakhstani
    English teachers participated in professional development webinars.\n\nIn 2018,
    American teaching assistants will help improve English language instruction in
    provinces across Kazakhstan.\nThe “English Access Microscholarship” program has
    helped 480 economically disadvantaged youth attend after-school classes and summer
    learning activities.\nThe United States funds the “English for Journalists” program,
    which will improve the professional qualifications of 230 Kazakhstani journalists.\nBolashak
    Program. In 1993, Kazakhstan launched the Bolashak presidential scholarship program
    for international study.  ‘Bolashak’, which means ‘future’ in Kazakh, demonstrates
    the importance Kazakhstan places on educating its youth at the best universities
    in the world.\n\nThe Bolashak Program is a recognized, all-expenses paid scholarship
    awarded to high-performing students from Kazakhstan for graduate study at an overseas
    university.\nThe United States has worked with the Bolashak program to help with
    the selection process and to widen the number of U.S. universities participating
    in the program.\nSince its inception in 1993, more than 12,500 Kazakhstani students
    have been awarded Bolashak scholarships, with 2,315 completing a course of study
    in the United States. Upon completion of their graduate degree, Bolashak scholars
    return to work in Kazakhstan for at least five years.  Currently, 358 Kazakhstani
    Bolashak scholars are studying at U.S. institutions of higher learning."

    During his participation at the 2nd Belt & Road Forum, the First President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev has proposed to form a new global architecture “Triple D”, which stands for the need to establish “Three Dialogues” in contemporary geopolitical reality.

    __The first “D”__ affects the global level - the establishment of a dialogue between the United States, Russia, China and the EU.

    __The second “D”__ touches upon #Eurasia with aim to unite the potentials of the #CICA and the OSCE.

    __The third “D”__ stands for a systematic economic dialogue between the Eurasian Economic Union, EU, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ASEAN.

    Within the working visit to the Republic of Lebanon the head of the Kazakhstan defense agency Major General N. Yermekbayev got familiarized with the everyday activities of the military personnel of Kazakhstan peacekeeping contingent and its rotation process and also held negotiations with Lebanese National Defense Minister Elias Bou Saab.

    During his visit to a zone of responsibility of the IndKazBat battalion, which includes the Kazakhstan peacekeeping company, the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan Major General N. Yermekbayev got familiarized with the everyday activities of the military personnel of Kazakhstan peacekeeping contingent and its rotation process.
    The zone of responsibility of the Kazakhstan peacekeeping contingent directly includes the territories of the eastern part of the so-called [“Blue Line”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Line_(Lebanon)), which corresponds to the internationally recognized border of Lebanon and considered to be the most disputed line of separation of the parties to the conflict.

    The Kazakhstan military personnel for six months carried out tasks of maintaining peace and security in the region, performed functions on the area patrol, organization of observation posts, monitoring the cease-fire observance, assistance to the civilian population and also participated in all events conducted by the headquarters of a mission.

    “The fulfillment of the peacekeeping mission is a matter of national importance. This is the fulfillment of the international obligations of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the World community and the United Nations. The UN leadership constantly notes our country’s adjusted approach in promoting international peace and security,” noted the head of the defense agency of Kazakhstan speaking in front of peacekeepers.

    It should be noted that for the first time in the history of the Republic of Kazakhstan the national peacekeeping company of 120 military personnel and 3 staff officers was sent to the Republic of Lebanon to carry out the mission on maintaining peace and security. The Command of the UN mission in Lebanon, as well as the IndKazBat battalion, highly evaluate the training of Kazakhstan peacekeepers.

    Besides, during the visit the negotiations between the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan Major General N. Yermekbayev and the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of Lebanon Elias Bou Saab were held. Following the results of the meeting, the parties confirmed their readiness to develop interaction between the defense agencies of Kazakhstan and Lebanon, discussed promising directions of cooperation and also shared views on topical issues of the international and regional agenda.
    Major General N. Yermekbayev thanked the Lebanese side for their assistance in the deployment of the Kazakhstan peacekeeping company within participation in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon mission.

    In turn, Mr. Elias Bou Saab thanked the Republic of Kazakhstan for the decision to contribute to the efforts on maintaining peace and security within the framework of the United Nations.

    *The article was initially published in Liter Kazakh newspaper, issue No. 64*

    The String Quartet's tour geography is exceptionally wide: the ensemble successfully performs in many of Kazakhstan's cities and gives brilliant performances in the leading concert halls of Russia, France, England, Austria, Spain, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Germany, Japan, and the Principality of Liechtenstein, to name but a few.

    The Kazakh Quartet – the Gaziza Zhubanova State String Quartet – is a guest at Liter's guest room today.

    This Wednesday, music was played in the editorial office for the first time. Live, real, fascinating, touching the soul, exciting the imagination and overwhelming the senses. The famous “Aday" by Kurmangazy swept like a fresh breeze over the editorial computers, telephones, diaries, and seemed to make home in the soul of every person who was lucky enough to be there at this time.

    Please meet:

    Aidar Toktaliyev – first violin

    Alexei Lebedev – second violin

    Bekzat Sailaubaiuly – alto

    Yernar Myntayev – cello, artistic director

    They didn't come to our office empty-handed – each one of them was carefully carrying his instrument. Those instruments were also cared for with great love many hundreds of years before these musicians were even born. It's true. For example, the cello which the artistic director of the quartet plays was “born" in the 18th century. Yernar even buys a separate plane ticket so that the instrument is not damaged in the luggage section. And when asked whether it's true that a cello is jealous of its musician and doesn't allow them to start a family for a long time, he smiles mysteriously...

    Bright, sociable, talented – the members of the quartet organically complement each other, despite the difference in age and looks. Two Kazakhs, a Kyrgyz and a Mari speak in unison in the language of music. But it was not always this way. Over the last 30 years the quartet experienced different periods of revival.

    __It all started with a prophecy__

    Yernar, the artistic director of the ensemble, is part of the original quartet. He was one of four students of the Ahmet Zhubanov music school who was praised and given a start in life by the daughter of the legendary musician and an outstanding personality Gaziza Zhubanova.

    Yernar Myntayev:

    “It was Dina Churenova who formed our first line-up. She was our violin tutor. We were studying at a music school when she suggested we play as a quartet. At the beginning, it was simply interesting to us, but when she played Beethoven performed by the famous Borodin quartet, we had a 'culture shock': HOW someone can play like THAT? Can a quartet sound like that?!

    Ever since that moment, that 'virus' poisoned our blood, we wanted to play music for real and become a quartet. That was in 1988.

    That is when the history of the string quartet began – the quartet that was born in the Ahmet Zhubanov specialised music boarding school for gifted children."

    Rehearsals took place, followed by competitions and success. We put all our efforts to perform at almost every school concert organised for students. One day, after one of such concert, she approached Mukhtar Uteuov who was then Director of the Philharmonic: “Dear Mukhtar, please save this ensemble and show them your support if possible. You will see – they will make our art famous across the world," she told him.

    Mr Uteuov kept his promise and offered every support he could. It was he who managed to secure the “State" status for the quartet.

    “It was very important for us. It was in 1995 when we started to go on tours with Mr Uteuov's help. And the fact that famous Gaziza Zhubanova predicted such a fate for us, helps us to this day," says Yernar.

    It is not by chance that the ensemble is named after this great woman.

    __The triumphant march__

    The International Shostakovich String Quartet Competition in Moscow was a landmark event for the ensemble. The titan of quartet art Valentin Berlinsky noticed them. The Embassy of Kazakhstan kindly requested him to give a masterclass to the ensemble. After listening to their performance, Berlinsky praised their talent:

    “Guys, I can see fire in your eyes. You are not just quartet music lovers, you are really devoted to it. From now on you can call me any time, and if I am in Moscow, I will teach you free of charge".

    Until the end of his life, he took on the patronage of 'his Kazakhs', as he used to say. Having such a master as an ally, the quartet begun its triumphant march around the world.

    Taking lessons from Rainer Schmidt, a member of the Hagen quartet, which is considered one of the top quartets in the world, didn't come easily.

    Rainer suggested they go through a qualifying competition: “Come and take part in a competition and if you deserve it, I will teach you, but if there is someone better than you, well then I'm sorry". The quartet's answer was: “Give us a chance and we will not fail".

    Learning from the world's best quartet schools, the State String Quartet is developing its own unique sound that touches the hearts of true lovers of high-quality quartet music.

    __Everyone is in charge here__

    Four people in an ensemble is, in fact, not a lot. However, if we consider that each one of the four is a figure with a NAME, one can't help but wonder how they manage to coexist peacefully, without hitting each other's “starry" foreheads?

    As the artistic director of the ensemble, Yernar provides a simple explanation to this question. Every person in the quartet is in charge. If the first violin is the face of the quartet, the second violin is no less important – it is the heart. And the alto and the cello are no less important organs of this organism. Only together can they produce a powerful energy, the expected result.

    The members of the ensemble admit that each one of them could pursue a solo career, but the love for the quartet is stronger and higher than their own ambitions. “The quartet genre is considered an elite and complex genre in classical music. And in this genre, not only abilities, but also human qualities are important, it's like a family" Yernar explains.

    Each of the participants took his own path to the quartet. The first violin was searched for almost a year.

    Aidar Toktaliyev:

    “I grew up in a musical family. My dad plays the bassoon, and my mom plays the piano. So, my future was predetermined. I would like to note that I have never regretted this. My mom wanted me to play the violin. And that's exactly what happened.

    When I was a student of the Kulyash Baiseitova music school and took classes from the legendary tutor Nina Patrusheva, who educated many famous violinists, such as Aiman Musakhodzhayeva, Marat Bisengaliev, and Gaukhar Myrzabekova, I received an invitation to a quartet. And she [Patrusheva] gave me her blessing.

    That's how I joined the quartet. We have been together for almost 15 years now. We set ourselves high goals. There is no limit to perfection, and the most pleasant part is that we reach those goals and strive to become even better."

    Alexei Lebedev:

    “And in my life, music appeared by chance. I come from a working-class family, from the Republic of Mari El. In Yoshkar-Ola, there is a National Presidential School, and its tutors travelled to villages and conducted auditions throughout the country. And I was invited to further auditions.

    My mother was against it, because when I entered school I had to live in a boarding school. But my father and my sister supported me.

    I remember being asked: what do you want to play? I answered: the violin. And I have been playing it ever since.

    In Kazan, I continued my studies in a specialised school. Then I studied in a music academy. During my 4th year I decided to take part in a competition to join the quartet and succeeded. My tutors supported me, everything contributed to my arrival in Kazakhstan. I have already taken root here, I am married to a Kazakh woman, and we are raising two children.

    Bekzat Sailaubaiuly:

    “My mother instilled a love for music in me. She was not a professional musician but played the dombra and the kobyz [traditional Kazakh musical instruments]. And she dreamed of seeing me and my brother in music. Once she took us to an audition to a music school. My brother took the exam and I was running around repeating everything. The tutors noticed me and that's how I stayed to learn music.

    Ernar Myntayev:

    “There are no musicians in our family either but we all love to sing. My mom worked at the Zhubanov musical school and wanted me to enrol to dombra classes. However, her friend – the late Zaira Sadvokasova – looked at my hands, checked my skills and convinced my mom that I should play cello instead. Initially, mom did not agree and kept on insisting the dombra was for me. But Zaira talked her out of the idea by saying: “if he masters a string instrument, he will eventually be able to play dombra. There is a lack of cello players in the country, don't waste your chance".

    This is how I ended up in the hands of my great tutor Zhukeyev. Yes, my years of study were not easy – there have been tears, failures, slacking off. But once my teacher took me to a concert where I heard a professional cellist playing. It was so beautiful, the tender, divine music sounded as if it was coming out of his chest, not out of his cello. And I asked my tutor: “Will I ever be able to play like that?" He said, of course, all you need is to study diligently and not miss your classes. And after that I never skipped my cello classes.

    __Performing as one__

    The young musicians frequently perform overseas where their fans call them “The Kazakh Quartet" and always greet them warmly. Three months ago, they performed in Qatar, the concert hall was full, and after the performance one of the guests came to the dressing room to compliment the musicians: “Guys, you all sound like a single 16-string instrument. How do you do that?" It was an extremely pleasing and important feedback.

    “When we perform as a single unit and the audience hears that – it is a fantastic feeling", Yernar says. “Sometimes, after playing the first chord I feel like I am flying. The piece lasts some 20 minutes, and I only regain my consciousness when I find myself playing the last chord and have no idea how I spent all that time. And only looking at the enormously exited and cheering audience I understand that we have just produced something extraordinary."

    The members of the quartet also fondly remember a lucky coincidence in Switzerland where they spent two years as Bolashak [Presidential scholarship in Kazakhstan] students trained in the academy of music by Ryan Schmidt – one of the best professors of quartet music.

    “There were other quartets besides us, including from Japan, England, Switzerland, Spain. And at the gala concert which we were closing, we played Mendelssohn. There were not too many people in the audience, the room was not full. A regular small concert, nothing unusual. However, after our performance one of the guests came to us super excited and asked where we were from. He said he listened to that music many times, performed by European quartets. However, he said, I listened to your music with particular inspiration and had goose bumps all over my body. What's so special about you, does your blood run in your veins in a different way? He immediately started Googling Kazakhstan and was surprised to find that our country was in the middle of endless steppes. That person turned out to be president of a music label which focuses on chamber music. For many years, he had been searching for a quarter that would be worthy of working with. We were lucky enough to be noticed by him and he invited us to come any time and record our music. He promised to cover all expenses", says the art director of the quartet.

    However, despite the wide public acclaim and praise from professional musicians, the quartet does not want to rest on its laurels. They have charted extremely ambitious plans and possess enough energy and stamina to put them into practice.

    “A lot is changing for the better in our country, including in classical music. I remember once we were driving in a taxi in Hamburg, and the taxi driver was listening to Mozart on the radio. He even sang along with the music. I remember well how I sincerely envied the fact that they had classical music on the radio and that the taxi driver understands the art as easily as car parts. And today, we too have the “Klassika" radio, and more and more people go to opera and ballet. We almost always have full audience halls. This is a good progress!" says Yernar without hiding his positive feelings.

    “We are still young and a have our lives ahead," he repeats. And one can't help but believe him. A man who has lived with great music for three decades and is literally one with the idea of the quartet, will master a lot.

    Although there are many difficulties on the path of stardom too. The main one is the money. Classical music is not as well-regarded as pop music by global audiences. Any travel abroad requires financing. The possibilities for the Philharmonic are limited. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan is doing everything possible to promote domestic classical performers. And the musicians themselves try to not develop dull, serious programmes, but mix different genres and performances. Most performances are held in Almaty, because there are more chamber halls there. And in the capital, the quartet plays in the Astana Opera, for which it is thankful to the theatre director Galym Akhmedyarov.

    “Next year, the whole world will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the great German composer Beethoven. And we will not stay aside. The composer left a great legacy – 16 string concerts. We have divided them into 6 concerts and are planning to prepare a concert season with all of Beethoven's cycles," the quartet's artistic director says, sharing their plans.

    The young musicians also have a dream of hosting an international competition of string quartets named after Gaziza Zhubanova.

    “This will be a fantastic promotion of Kazakh culture, including the works of Gaziza Zhubanova," says Yernar. “We are open to communication; we are ready to share our knowledge and experience. We ought to have a lot of string quartets. And if there are mentorship offers, we will be happy to respond," Yernar Myntayev assured our readers.

  body: "12 June 2019    \nDear Elbasy!    \nDear compatriots!\n\nFirst of all, I
    would like to express my profound thanks to the people of Kazakhstan who have
    supported me during the campaign and placed their faith in my presidency. \nThe
    elections reinforced our country’s principles of democracy. There was fair and
    open competition at the polling stations.\n\nPoliticians from all sides engaged
    in the process. It was an open contest where political parties and policies were
    judged on their merits. There is a common saying that “Elections are simply a
    race of opinions”.\n\nIndeed, this is a fair comparison.\nIn the most important
    political race in our nation’s history, the wisdom and good judgment of our people
    prevailed. This victory is a victory for all our people!\nAs a progressive, unified
    nation, we have collectively chosen the way forward for Kazakhstan’s future development.\n\nThe
    opinion of each citizen who voted for a bright future on June 9 matters. It matters
    to us.  After all, our most important, common values are the peace, unity and
    solidarity of our people. Protecting these values should be a priority for all
    of us. \n\nTherefore, as Kazakhstan’s newly elected President, I would like to
    say the following to our people:\n\nMy ultimate goal is to protect the interests
    of every citizen. I will not allow anyone or anything to drive a wedge between
    us, based on a difference of political views or positions. \n\nI will consider
    the valuable proposals and initiatives which are put forward by various political
    and community leaders. \n\nWe will continue to work openly and fairly.\nThe most
    important principle for us is to serve loyally, in accordance with the law.\nThere
    is only one Homeland for us!\nOur destiny is common!\n\nWe will work together
    for the benefit of our people!\n\nIn these elections our citizens voted to support
    the strategic direction of the First President!\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev has built
    a model of development that was recognized worldwide. Thanks to him, the pale-blue
    flag of Kazakhstan is waving around the world.\nOver recent days, I have received
    many letters from our fellow citizens.\nAll of them share the same common vision,
    to follow the path, preserve and strengthen the strategy of the First President.\n\nIn
    fact, it is a legitimate request of the people to call for such a thing. \nThe
    progress of modern Kazakhstan is, first and foremost, thanks to the work and dedication
    of the First President.\n\nElbasy is the founder of the Kazakh state, a statesman
    on a global scale. And so it is written in world history. It is a common duty
    for all of us to respect the great service the First President has done for our
    people and the global community.\nDear compatriots!\n\nDuring the election campaign,
    I visited many parts of the country. \nMy political platform has been developed
    in response to the main requests of our citizens.\n\nFirst, I will work on the
    implementation of the Third Modernisation of Kazakhstan, the implementation of
    Five Institutional reforms and other important strategic state projects. In other
    words, I am going to work to deliver on the First President’s long-term Strategy.\n\nNew
    approaches and new solutions are needed for the country to reach the next level
    of sustainable development. They will soon be made public.Secondly, I plan to
    specifically address acute social problems, providing assistance to those most
    in need. The government will take concrete steps to achieve tangible results in
    this area. We need to make serious changes to our social policy. We need to systematically
    reform our social policies.\n\nThird. I will support Kazakh entrepreneurs, attract
    and protect investments, stimulate business activity, and expand our broad middle
    class.\nFourth. My goal is to ensure the unity of society and protect the rights
    of every citizen.\n\nAnd finally – always and forever I will defend the national
    interests of Kazakhstan.\nToday, the world has entered an era of rapid change.\nTechnology,
    economies and social order are changing. The vision of people, especially young
    people, is changing.\n\nKazakhstan faces new challenges and threats. As a long-term
    student of international relations, I feel the advent of a new era approaching.
    \n\nTrade wars, tensions in international relations, the breakdown of previous
    security mechanisms, the growth of regional conflicts –this is the new geopolitical
    reality.\nOver the coming years, the leading issues of our time will come to the
    fore: which countries will be able to effectively adapt and integrate to the new
    global realities, and who will be left on the sidelines of world development.\nEconomic,
    social and political progress is our only correct response to the challenges of
    our time.\n\nWe are open to the world, striving to secure the best achievements
    and advanced technologies. Creative change for the benefit of all our people is
    how I view progress.\nAt the same time, the authorities are obliged to hear people’s
    demands, solve problems on the ground, and must be accountable to the citizens.\nNot
    promise, but act! This rule should be followed by all members of the government
    and the regional mayors across the country. \n\nAs President, the most important
    measure of progress is not the overall figure of economic development, but the
    real well-being of all citizens.\nTherefore, when making decisions on strategic
    issues, the view of the people will be considered.\n\nThe formula of our state
    governance: a strong, empowered President – an influential, capable Parliament
    – a government accountable to the people.\nIt is this political system that best
    meets the needs of our state, responds to complex geopolitical realities and contributes
    to the implementation of the strategic tasks facing us.\n\nAt the same time, the
    political transformation of society will continue.\nThe political structures and
    institutions must align with wide-ranging economic transformations, otherwise
    the reforms may be stifled.\nThis is clearly evidenced by international experience.\nOnly
    decent, educated people, appointed based on meritocracy, should work within public
    administration. There can be no other principle of recruitment.\nOverall, we must
    raise the responsibility of the authorities to the needs of people. Special attention
    will be paid to the development of civil society.\n\nDear people!\nMy pre-election
    campaign focused on a wide-ranging public consultation.\nOn May 13, 2019, the
    national action #BIRGE began.\nIts main goal is to identify the most important
    tasks in the development of the country.\nVarious proposals were collected from
    all regions of Kazakhstan.\nAt this point, approximately 540,000 proposals have
    been received.  \nI express my sincere gratitude to everyone who took part in
    the #BIRGE action and showed civic pride.  \n\nNow we can clearly identify actual
    problems facing society.\nWe know how to solve them. What is the public most concerned
    about today? \n\nFirstly, citizens want justice everywhere.\nThe citizens require
    state bodies to provide proper service that starts, first of all, from social
    policy. \nThe main issue of concern is the reduction of incomes.\nThe destabilisation
    of international financial markets and the devaluation of the tenge had a negative
    impact on people’s incomes.\nMore than a million of our citizens had to take a
    loan from a bank.\nThe gap between high and low-income citizens is another pressing
    issue that concerns society. Of course, such challenges are present in every nation,
    but we cannot stand aside and let this issue go unaddressed.   \n\nTherefore,
    we must take action in the medium term to address these acute socio-economic and
    political problems. The current poor state of the environment is another matter
    of public concern.\n\nTherefore, we need to develop and adopt a single environmental
    policy.\nA new environmental code would give impetus to a system of environmental
    protection.\nThe next problem is access to the water supply.\n\nEvery home, every
    family shall have access to clean drinking water.\nAnother important issue of
    public concern is the quality of roads.\nThat is why improving road conditions
    is one of our main goals.\nOne of the biggest challenges that we face in the 21st
    Century is digitisation. \nWe must embrace it in all spheres of our life starting
    with the provision of public services through to the creation of the new branches
    in the future economy.\nThe development of the country, including political progress
    is directly connected to digitisation.\n\nIt will improve the relationship between
    the state and society. \nTherefore, the state programme Digital Kazakhstan first
    introduced by Leader of the Nation must be completed.  \nOur citizens are deeply
    concerned about the development of dialogue between the government and the society.
    \n\nThis dialogue should be based on the recognition of pluralism of opinion.
    Different views, but one united nation – this is the main guideline.\nThat is
    why I decided to establish the National Council of Public Trust. \nThis Council
    shall embrace all the representatives of society, including the youth. \nThe first
    meeting of the National Council of Public Trust will take place in August this
    year. \nThe authorities are obliged to fulfill their promises which they made
    to the people. It is our primary mission. It is the only way to strengthen the
    unity of the nation and maintain stability in the country. \n\nTherefore, a substantial
    programme regarding the implementation of my election platform shall be developed.\n\nThe
    best ideas and initiatives put forward by the people will be reflected in this
    document.We must pay special attention to the following important directions:\n\nFirst
    Direction. \nIncreasing the income of the population.\nThis issue can only be
    resolved through sustained and dynamic economic growth.\nFirst, we need to deeply
    understand why we need growth.\nIn order for our citizens to be able to live and
    work in their country, raise children, rejoice and be proud of the achievements
    of our people, there must be economic growth.\nSoon, at the enlarged meeting of
    the government, we will define specific tasks for the socio-economic development
    of the country.\n\nSecond direction. \nEradication of corruption.\nA package of
    reforms aimed at minimising the level of corruption will be prepared by September
    1.\nCorruption is an issue that hinders the country’s development. It is a scourge
    that threatens mutual respect in society and the security of the state as a whole.\nWe
    will carry out systematic work to combat corruption.\n\nThird direction. \nReform
    of the judicial and law enforcement systems.\nThe courts system is the key to
    the rule of law. Therefore, judges must meet high professional and moral standards
    – a big task.   \nThe system used to evaluate and select judges and candidates
    for this post should be strengthened.\nThe court must be the ultimate arbitrator
    of justice.\nThe main task of the law enforcement system is to gain the trust
    of the people. \n\nFourth direction.\nCreation of new jobs and provision of decent
    wages.\nThe question of equitable distribution of national income is a strategically
    important point.\n\nIt is necessary to allocate funds from the state budget, in
    the first instance, for long-term goals and the creation of new jobs.\nFifth direction.\nA
    solution to the housing problem.\nI pay special attention to the availability
    of affordable housing for many different groups of citizens.   \nOur task is to
    develop a common housing policy. \nThe government will take concrete measures
    in this regard.\n\nSixth direction.\nFair social policy.\nWe will continue to
    be focused on a policy of the sustainable development of human capital.\nWhat
    do we need to do in this regard?\n1 - Support for wide-scale education.  \n2-
    Provision of quality medical services to the entire population.  \nWe are developing
    new policies to help expand delivery of these issues. \nWe will adopt new laws
    that will raise the status of teachers and doctors. We will create favorable conditions
    to protect their rights and improve their financial situation.\n\nSeventh direction.\nNew
    guidelines for regional development.\nOur principle are widely known.\nWe believe
    that strong regions equals a strong Kazakhstan.\nSpecific issues of concern to
    our citizens should be resolved at the local level.\nWe will strengthen the system
    of local self-government.\nThe population will be given the powers to collectively
    address regional problems. \n\nEighth direction.\nThe values of “Ruhani Zhangyru”
    will remain our main spiritual guide.\nHonouring history, loyalty to the Motherland,
    the pursuit of science and knowledge are all noble qualities of our people.\nThese
    qualities strengthen the unity of our people and the creation of the nation, contributing
    to the formation of a competitive country.    \nYoung people will lead Kazakhstan
    into the future. \nTherefore, we must direct this programme to the education of
    the younger generation.\nNinth direction.\n\nForeign policy.\nKazakhstan has earned
    great international prestige and established itself as a peace-loving, open country,
    as well as a reliable and responsible partner in global affairs. \nWe will continue
    on our path of a constructive, balanced, multi-vector foreign policy.\nWe will
    firmly promote and defend our national interests on the global stage.\nOur foreign
    policy will bring concrete benefits to the country, national businesses and every
    citizen.\n\nTenth direction.\nI separately want to appeal to the youth. \nYou
    must play a crucial role in the development of Kazakhstan, and to become the driving
    force of progress.\nElbasy declared 2019 the Year of Youth. The special project
    “Zhastar - Yel Tіregі” was just the start.\nWe are implementing a programme for
    the development of youth business initiatives called “Zhas kіsіpker”, we will
    offer greater support to youth startups. We will introduce youth employment programmes.\nMy
    task is to create opportunities so that you can fulfil your dreams, achieve your
    goals and create your personal “success story”. \nA “Presidential personnel reserve”
    will be created in order to promote young talented managers at all levels of the
    public service.\nOur young people are self-motivated, hardworking and creative,
    that is why the future of Kazakhstan is in safe hands.\n\nDear Compatriots!\nWe
    have a great task before our nation!\nOur goal is clear, and our path is open!\nKazakhstan
    has become a country of new opportunities and prospects.\nOur youth and future
    generations will reap the benefits of these opportunities.\nWe are a nation that
    honours the traditions of our ancestors while striving for the best global achievements.\n\nThis
    is the pillar of our strength.\nWe are going to overcome all the challenges ahead.\nWe
    will work together for the development of a strong and prosperous Kazakhstan.\nFaithfulness
    to my oath and a firm commitment to the obligation is my duty to the people.\nI
    promise to work hard for the bright future of Kazakhstan, for the people. \nI
    wish all of you good health and happiness.\nLong live our beloved Motherland –
    the Republic of Kazakhstan!\n\n\n"

  body: "Twenty seven years have passed since the historic moment when the First President
    \nElbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree to approve the provisions of the
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan, of Embassy of the Republic
    of Kazakhstan and of the main duties and rights of Ambassador Extraordinary and
    Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Kazakhstan. This launched the beginning of
    a new and interesting chapter in the history of Kazakhstan's diplomacy. \n\nDuring
    this time under the leadership of First President Elbasy, Kazakhstan developed
    its own, unique and pragmatic foreign policy model. At its core lies the multi-vector
    and balanced approach to cooperation with the countries of the West and the East
    including Europe and Asia. And no matter how the world around us has changed in
    the past decades, our country continues to follow its previously identified priorities
    on the world stage. \n\nContinued cooperation with its partners and a commitment
    to strategic principles have become a recognizable hallmark of national diplomacy.
    In his inaugural speech, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev noted,
    \"Kazakhstan has won great prestige in the world, has established itself as a
    peace-loving, open country, reliable and responsible partner in international
    affairs. We will continue constructive multi-vector foreign policy course\". \n\nThroughout
    these years Kazakhstan has strongly positioned itself through numerous effective
    initiatives in international security, dialogue and cooperation, including global
    nuclear safety and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This also
    includes participation in establishing prestigious international organizations
    such as the SCO, CSTO, CICA and etc. as well as strengthening dialogue between
    religions, effective peacemaking, and humanitarian assistance to the countries
    in need. \n\nWe can continue listing our accomplishments for a long time. But
    more importantly, during this very short historical period of time, we have confidently
    made our way from being recognized to becoming active partner in world affairs.
    Our country has made and continues to make its contribution to solving regional
    and global problems of the modern era. Kazakhstan consciously takes a proactive
    stance at the international level, promoting pragmatic initiatives and ideas,
    many of which have long been implemented. \n\nKazakhstan has consciously built
    around itself a belt of good neighborliness and a reliable system of relations
    with all the countries of the world and international organizations. As a result,
    our country has clearly positioned itself for many years as a prestigious and
    reliable partner, strong supporter of peace, a pillar of regional stability and
    steward of international dialogue. \n\nAnd all of this constructive foreign policy
    capital is consistently transformed into tangible economic benefits and advantages
    for development of our country. Indeed, more than $300 billion worth of foreign
    direct investments brought into Kazakhstan's economy in the past decades best
    of all speaks to the confidence and trust that the global community has in us.
    Kazakhstan has gained this trust through its consistent work, rational foreign
    policy decisions and responsibility in international cooperation. \n\nAt the same
    time the role of our country in the global geo-economic processes is increasing
    every year. Thanks to the construction of the modern Silk Road, our country is
    presently successfully connecting  the remote regions of Greater Eurasia and establishing
    itself as a land bridge between the three oceans - the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian.
    This substantially changes economic prospects of continentally isolated Kazakhstan
    and opens new development opportunities.  \n\nAs a result, the international interest
    in our country as a valuable partner is increasing every year. Thanks to the domestic
    stability and development of our infrastructure, delivery of goods  to and from
    Europe to Asia via Kazakhstan takes four times less than delivery by traditional
    sea routes. We are already seeing concrete results - in 2018 our country's income
    from transit exceeded $1.5 billion and is expected to reach $5 billion in the
    future. \n\nThanks to the good-neighborliness belt and thoughtful foreign strategy,
    Kazakhstan is becoming the main getaway and key transit link in Eurasian continental
    trade. Because of our growing communication network, the country of the great
    steppe, strategically unites the large European, Asian and Middle Eastern markets
    and forms the foundation for a new continental geo-economy. This is a real example
    of how we are converting foreign policy achievements into the real economic return.
    \n\nOur world is experiencing a period of rapid transformation as technologies,
    economy and social order are changing in a complex and dynamic way. In this context,
    our Head of State is setting a clear direction of international activity. \"We
    will firmly promote and defend our national interests on the global stage. Our
    foreign policy will bring concrete benefits to the country, national businesses
    and every citizen\", noted President in his inaugural speech.\n\nAnd thanks to
    the accumulated experience and professionalism, Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry
    is quickly adapting to the changing global realities. We continue constructive
    cooperation to promote dialogue and strengthen security. At the same time, to
    support the growth of our nation's economy, our diplomacy is efficiently focused
    on actively promoting our country's economic interests in the new international
    environment. \n\nIt is known that direct investments as well as industrial projects
    and transfer of technology  are effective drivers of growth and diversification
    of the economy. Investments, in a complex way, contribute to the creation of new
    jobs, improve qualifications of Kazakhstan personnel, and introduce innovation
    as well as increase tax revenues into the state budget. \n\nIn the light of the
    currently growing international competition for investment capital, Kazakhstan
    is shifting to a new tactic of working with foreign investors. In response to
    new world trends, the country is building a new ecosystem to attract and retain
    investments.  \n\nToday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan has been
    entrusted with the task of coordinating investment activities at all levels -
    regional, nationwide and international. The Foreign Ministry pragmatically focuses
    on synchronizing the interactions between all relevant government organizations
    and departments using its accumulated knowledge and experience. \n\nOne of the
    key departments, the Committee on Investments, has now become a part of the Foreign
    Ministry. Today, the working potential and skills of the Committee are being integrated
    into the daily diplomatic activity at all 93 foreign missions of Kazakhstan. This
    gives them additional tools and mechanisms to attract foreign investment. \n\nKazakhstan
    sets itself a serious goal to strengthen the stability of FDI inflow, making the
    country highly attractive for major global companies. The role of the Council
    of Foreign Investors under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan is significantly
    enhanced within the updated structure for working with investors. For more than
    20 years, the Council has been successfully and efficiently engaged in solving
    strategic issues to ensure a favorable  investment climate. It has become a significant
    platform for the direct exchange of views, ideas and proposals for improving the
    investment image of our country.\n\nThe upcoming 32nd plenary meeting of the Council
    of Foreign Investors with participation of the Head of State aims at bringing
    Kazakhstan's work to attract FDI into nation's economy to a new level through
    developing human capital. The Council's activities are now coordinated by the
    Foreign Ministry and in these new conditions, Kazakhstan's diplomats will once
    again make every effort to transform foreign policy opportunities achieved over
    the years into a promising economic prospects. As the history of our Ministry
    shows, the experience, competence and knowledge is already here. \n"

  body: "By Nurlan Nigmatulin,\nChairman of the Majilis of the Parliament of Kazakhstan\n\nA
    major event important not only for Kazakhstan, but for all European and Asian
    countries will take place in our capital this autumn. On 23-24 September, the
    city of Nur-Sultan will host the Fourth Meeting of Speakers of the Eurasian Countries’
    Parliaments titled “Greater Eurasia: Dialogue. Trust. Partnership.”\n\nThe topic
    proposed by Kazakhstan reflects the course towards the development and strengthening
    of interaction between the countries of Europe and Asia to ensure safe and sustainable
    development of Eurasia.\n\nEurasia is a pillar of the modern world. It is the
    largest continent, covering 65% of the world’s population, 75% of energy resources
    and 40% of global GDP.\n\nAt the same time, the diversity of economic systems,
    the huge imbalance in the level of development between parts of the continent,
    as well as the increasing trend towards regionalisation, prevent us from describing
    Eurasia as a single economic entity.\nThe current level of trade and economic
    interdependence requires closer interaction from everyone and consideration for
    the interests of the Eurasian countries.\n\nKazakhstan’s main message is to position
    Eurasia as a platform for testing a fundamentally new partnership model based
    on a joint, collective solution of the emerging disagreements between certain
    states, as well as countering common challenges.\nThe First President of Kazakhstan,
    Nursultan Nazarbayev, first announced the idea of Eurasian integration in 1994
    and, after a number of development stages, it is being implemented today in the
    shape of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). This year marks the 25th anniversary
    of his Eurasian integration initiative.\n\nSubsequently, the strategic initiative
    to build partnerships across the Eurasian continent, proposed by Nursultan Nazarbayev,
    was enshrined in the Astana Declaration of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation
    in Europe (OSCE) in 2010. The OSCE Participating States declared their commitment
    to the principle of a common and indivisible Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian community.\n\nIn
    2015, in his statement from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly, the First
    President of Kazakhstan proposed the idea of creating a Greater Eurasia, which
    means bringing together the Eurasian Economic Union, the Silk Road Economic Belt
    and the European Union in a single integration project.\n\nThe unprecedented project
    of Greater Eurasia calls for the harmonisation of the efforts of these entities
    and initiatives, including the liberalisation of trade relations between their
    participants, joint development of transport corridors, diversification of energy
    routes, expansion of investment cooperation and other issues of economic interaction.\n\nIn
    April 2019, at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in
    Beijing, Nursultan Nazarbayev invited the world community to create a new geopolitical
    reality of 3D, which proposes the establishment of the Three Dialogues.\n\nThe
    first dialogue is needed at the global level between the United States, Russia,
    China and the European Union.\n\nThe second dialogue is needed at the level of
    Eurasia in order to bring together the capabilities of the Conference on Interaction
    and Confidence Building Measures in Asia and the Organisation for Security and
    Cooperation in Europe.\nThe third dialogue would be a systemic economic dialogue
    between the Eurasian Economic Union, the European Union, the Shanghai Cooperation
    Organisation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The development of
    economic cooperation in such a format can, firstly, give a powerful impetus to
    the development of our countries, the growth of economies and the improvement
    of the well-being of citizens. Secondly, it can create new sources of diversification,
    strengthening competitiveness, improving the business climate and increasing the
    investment attractiveness of states. Thirdly, it can transform into a call for
    the enhancement of the global role of Greater Eurasia.\n\nThe launch of these
    dialogues is in the common interest of all European and Asian countries, and will
    contribute to the formation of interconnections for a sustainable future of a
    united Eurasia.\n\nTherefore, the main objective of the Fourth Meeting of Speakers
    of the Eurasian Countries’ Parliaments is to establish a direct multilateral dialogue
    between the heads of legislative bodies of Europe and Asia, as well as heads of
    international and inter-parliamentary organisations to further deepen and expand
    cooperation in the Eurasian space.\n\nThe role of parliaments in identifying key
    areas of political and economic development of states will serve as a strong foundation
    for finding common points of interaction and mutually acceptable solutions at
    the regional and continental levels.\n\nThe main elements of the agenda can include:\n\nFirstly,
    coordination of the basic principles of economic development of the Eurasian space.\n\nThe
    key objective is the full realisation of the integration potential of Greater
    Eurasia, including through the development of transport and transit infrastructure,
    increasing mutual trade, expanding industrial and innovative cooperation – the
    arrival of a “moment of Eurasia,” a unique combination of international political
    and economic circumstances.\n\nSecondly, discussion of the algorithm of a dialogue
    through cultural and humanitarian ties and the development of inter-parliamentary
    interaction in the Eurasian space.\n\nIf we look at the history of the event,
    the initiators of this forum are the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia
    and the National Assembly of Korea. The previous three meetings were held in Moscow
    (2016), Seoul (2017) and Antalya (2018) and became an effective platform for discussing
    topical issues of cooperation in the interests of sustainable development and
    well-being of the Eurasian countries.\n\nThe number of the participants is growing
    every year. Delegations from 19 countries attended the first meeting in Moscow,
    delegations from 26 countries participated in the meeting in Seoul, while 38 countries
    were represented in Turkey.\n\nNow, the international parliamentary event of such
    a level will be held in Kazakhstan for the first time.\n\nThe heads of parliaments
    from 84 European and Asian countries and the heads of 16 international and inter-parliamentary
    organisations have been invited to the forum in Nur-Sultan.\n\nCurrently, we are
    carrying out a serious organisational and preparatory work. So far, parliamentarians
    from more than 50 countries have confirmed their participation, including speakers
    from more than 40 countries. All 16 international organisations have confirmed
    their attendance.\n\nThe participation of influential parliamentarians from Europe
    and Asia in the forum will provide an opportunity to exchange views on topical
    issues of development, as well as find a vision and practical recipes for moving
    towards a viable win-win model for Eurasia.\n\nThe outcome of the discussion,
    we hope, will be the adoption of the final document, the Joint Statement of the
    Speakers, which will reflect the views of parliamentarians on the further development
    of the Eurasian continent on the way to our common future.\n\nUltimately, the
    upcoming forum will contribute to the strengthening of comprehensive interaction
    and cooperation in Eurasia, and the development of inter-parliamentary contacts
    and partnership.\n\n__Нурлан Нигматулин,\nПредседатель Мажилиса Парламента Республики
    Казахстан__\n\nОсенью столица Казахстана станет местом проведения важного мероприятия
    не только для нашей страны, но и для всех стран Европы и Азии. 23-24 сентября
    2019 года в городе Нур-Султане состоится IV Совещание спикеров парламентов стран
    Евразии на тему «Большая Евразия: Диалог. Доверие. Партнерство».\n\nТема, выдвинутая
    Казахстаном, отражает курс на развитие и укрепление взаимодействия между странами
    Европы и Азии для формирования безопасного и устойчивого развития на территории
    Евразии.\n\nЕвразия представляет собой каркас современного мира. Это самый крупный
    по территории континент, охватывающий 65% населения планеты, 75% энергетических
    ресурсов и 40% глобального ВВП. Вместе с тем, неоднородность экономических систем,
    огромный дисбаланс в уровне развития между частями континента, а также усиливающийся
    тренд на регионализацию, не позволяют говорить о Евразии как о едином экономическом
    субъекте. \n\nСложившийся уровень торгово-экономической взаимозависимости требует
    от всех более тесного взаимодействия и учета интересов стран Евразии. \n\nГлавный
    посыл Казахстана заключается в позиционировании Евразии как площадки для апробации
    принципиально новой модели партнерства на основе совместного, коллективного решения
    возникающих противоречий между теми или иными государствами, а также противодействия
    общим вызовам.\n\nИдея «евразийской интеграции» Первого Президента Казахстана
    Нурсултана Назарбаева была обнародована в 1994 году и, пройдя ряд этапов развития,
    нашла сегодня свою реализацию в деятельности Евразийского экономического союза
    (ЕАЭС). Таким образом, в этом году исполнилось 25 лет его инициативе о евразийской
    интеграции.\n\nВ последующем, стратегическая инициатива выстраивания партнерства
    на всем евразийском континенте, предложенная Нурсултаном Назарбаевым, была закреплена
    в Астанинской декларации Организации по безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе
    (ОБСЕ) в 2010 году. Государства-члены Организации заявили о своей приверженности
    принципу общего и неделимого евроатлантического и евразийского сообщества. \n\nВ
    2015 году в своем выступлении с трибуны Генеральной Ассамблеи ООН Первый Президент
    Казахстана выдвинул идею создания «Большой Евразии», подразумевающей объединение
    в единый интеграционный проект Евразийского экономического союза, Экономического
    пояса Шелкового пути и Европейского союза. \n\nБеспрецедентный проект «Большой
    Евразии» предусматривает гармонизацию работы данных объединений и инициатив, включая
    либерализацию торговых отношений между их участниками, совместное развитие транспортных
    коридоров, диверсификацию энергетических маршрутов, расширение инвестиционного
    сотрудничества и другие вопросы экономического взаимодействия. \n\nВ апреле 2019
    года на сессии Второго форума международного сотрудничества «Один пояс, один путь»\nв
    Пекине Нурсултан Назарбаев предложил мировому сообществу создать новую геополитическую
    реальность \n«Три Д», которая означает необходимость налаживания «Трех диалогов».\n\nПервый
    диалог затрагивает глобальный уровень – это диалог между США, Россией, Китаем
    и Европейским Союзом.\n\nВторой диалог необходим на уровне Евразии с целью объединения
    потенциалов Совещания по взаимодействию и мерам доверия в Азии и Организации по
    безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе.\n\nТретий диалог – это системный экономический
    диалог между Евразийским экономическим союзом, Европейским Союзом, Шанхайской
    организацией сотрудничества и Ассоциацией стран Юго-Восточной Азии. Развитие экономической
    кооперации в таком формате способно, во-первых, дать мощнейший импульс для развития
    наших стран, роста экономик и повышения благополучия граждан. Во-вторых, создать
    новые источники диверсификации, укрепления конкурентоспособности, улучшения бизнес-климата
    и повышения инвестиционной привлекательности государств. В-третьих, трансформироваться
    в сигнал для повышения глобальной роли Большой Евразии.\n\nЗапуск вышеуказанных
    диалогов отвечает общим интересам всех стран Европы и Азии и будет способствовать
    формированию взаимосвязи для устойчивого будущего объединенной Евразии.\n\nПоэтому
    основной целью IV Совещания спикеров парламентов стран Евразии является налаживание
    прямого многостороннего диалога между главами законодательных органов государств
    Европы и Азии, а также руководителями международных и межпарламентских организаций
    для дальнейшего углубления и расширения взаимодействия и сотрудничества на пространстве
    Евразии.\n\nРоль парламентов в определении ключевых направлений политического
    и экономического развития государств послужит серьезной основой для поиска общих
    точек взаимодействия и взаимоприемлемых решений на региональном и континентальном
    уровнях. \n\nГлавными элементами повестки дня могут стать:\n- согласование основных
    принципов экономического развития Евразийского пространства. Здесь ключевым условием
    является полноценное раскрытие интеграционного потенциала «Большой Евразии», в
    том числе через развитие транспортно-транзитной инфраструктуры, наращивание взаимной
    торговли, расширение индустриального и инновационного сотрудничества (наступление
    «момента Евразии» - уникального стечения международных политических и экономических
    обстоятельств);\n- обсуждение алгоритма диалога через культурно-гуманитарные связи
    и развитие межпарламентского взаимодействия на Евразийском пространстве.\n\nЕсли
    обратиться к истории мероприятия, следует отметить, что инициаторами данного форума
    являются Государственная Дума Федерального Собрания Российской Федерации и Национальная
    Ассамблея Республики Корея. Предыдущие три Совещания прошли в Москве (апрель 2016г.),
    Сеуле (июнь 2017г.) и Анталии (октябрь 2018г.) и стали эффективной площадкой для
    обсуждения актуальных вопросов сотрудничества в интересах устойчивого развития
    и благополучия стран евразийского континента. \n\nС каждым годом расширяется формат
    участников. На первой встрече в Москве принимали участие делегации 19 стран, в
    Сеуле – 26 стран, в Турции - 38 стран. \n\nИ теперь международное парламентское
    мероприятие подобного уровня впервые состоится в Казахстане. \nНа межпарламентский
    форум в Нур-Султане приглашены главы парламентов 84 стран Европы и Азии и руководители
    16 международных и межпарламентских организаций. \n\nВ настоящее время нами проводится
    большая организационно-подготовительная работа. На сегодня свое участие уже подтвердили
    парламентарии из более 50 стран. В том числе участие на уровне первых руководителей
    – из 43 стран. Подтвердили участие все 16 международных организаций. \n\nУчастие
    авторитетных парламентариев стран Европы и Азии в работе форума позволит обменяться
    мнениями по актуальным вопросам современного развития, а также получить видение
    и практические рецепты по продвижению к жизнеспособной модели «всеобщего выигрыша»
    для Евразии.\n\nРезультатом дискуссии, как мы надеемся, должно стать принятие
    итогового документа – Совместного заявления спикеров, – которое отразит взгляды
    парламентариев на дальнейшее развитие евразийского континента на пути к нашему
    общему будущему. \n\nВ целом, предстоящий форум будет способствовать укреплению
    всестороннего взаимодействия и сотрудничества на Евразийском пространстве, развитию
    межпарламентских контактов и партнерства.\n\n"

    While there is an exclusion for some countries (USA is one of them), the general rule is that you do need to obtain a visa to visit Kazakhstan

    Starting from 1 January 2019, Kazakhstan introduced a pilot mode of the procedure for obtaining a single entry visa for foreigners in electronic format. The electronic visa is issued through the Visa and Migration [Portal](https://www.vmp.gov.kz).

    An electronic visa is issued based on an invitation from the Kazakh side, which is issued in the migration service units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan. Tourist electronic visas are issued to citizens of 117 states, business and medical treatment visas - to citizens of 23 states.

    __The passport provided by the recipient of a visa should meet the following criteria:__
    - should not cause doubts in authenticity and belonging to its owner, have reservations, notes, erasures and corrections, torn or unsewn pages;
    - should have at least 2 blank pages;
    - should expire no earlier than 3 months from the expiry date of the requested visa;
    - should not have marks of extension.
    When the travel document (passport) is replaced, the electronic visa must be obtained again. In case of discrepancies between the information in the electronic visa and in the travel document that proves the identity, the electronic visa is considered invalid and this may serve as a reason for refusing entry to Kazakhstan.

    Foreigners can enter/exit the territory of Kazakhstan using a valid electronic visa only through the checkpoints of international airports of Nur-Sultan and Almaty. When crossing the state border and during his/her stay in Kazakhstan, the foreigner must have the passport and the printed electronic visa.

    Foreigners with electronic visas are exempt from registration with the migration service authorities. The inviting side must inform the migration authorities about the foreigners staying with them within three working days from the date of their arrival.

    __Visa and Migration Portal (step-by-step e-visa issuance algorithm):__
    - in order to obtain an electronic visa, the foreigner should register on the website of the Visa and Migration Portal;
    - go to the “electronic visa" section and confirm the invitation;
    - learn about the requirements for obtaining an electronic visa;
    - enter the invitation number (sent by the inviting side) and fill in the passport details;
    - after confirming the invitation, confirm the compliance of the information in the electronic visa and in the travel document that proves the identity;
    - pay the consular fee online (it is important to return to the personal account of the portal after payment);
    - print the electronic visa (the visa is formed on the personal account);
    - present the printed electronic visa when passing through passport control at international airports in Nur-Sultan and Almaty.

    program that allows Kazakh women return to their homeland from Syria without the
    fear of being persecuted. Unlike virtually any Western country and most of the
    rest of the world, Kazakhstan is welcoming home women from the Islamic State rather
    than arresting them if they dare show up. \n\nAll repatriated women go through
    deradicalization programs, where they are provided with nannies to look after
    their children, fed hot meals and treated by doctors and psychologists. "

    минуту молчания по случаю Международного дня действий против ядерных испытаний,
    утвержденного резолюцией Генеральной Ассамблеи ООН 2 декабря 2009 года. Эта резолюция
    была инициирована Казахстаном.\n\nВ своем выступлении Посол РК в США Е.Казыханов
    особо отметил  вклад Казахстана и Первого Президента – Елбасы Н.А.Назарбаева в
    дело нераспространения ядерного оружия. \n\nКазахстан стал лидером международных
    усилий по укреплению режимов нераспространения оружия массового уничтожения и
    примером для других стран после решения Первого Президента – Елбасы Н.А.Назарбаева
    о закрытии Семипалатинского полигона и добровольном отказе от четвертого по величине
    ядерного арсенала в мире.\n\nВ результате ядерных испытаний на полигоне неподалеку
    от современного города Семей пострадало более миллиона человек.\nРеспублика Казахстан
    призывает людей во всем мире провести минуту молчания 29 августа в 11:05, в это
    время стрелки часов образуют римскую букву “V”, символизирующую победу.\n\nМеждународный
    день действий против ядерных испытаний призван более активно просвещать и информировать
    людей о последствиях испытательных взрывов ядерного оружия и любых других ядерных
    взрывов и необходимости их скорейшего прекращения."

  body: "## Внимание!!!\n## Уважаемые граждане,\n\nСообщаем, что властями штата Флорида
    объявлен режим чрезвычайного положения в связи с приближением урагана четвертой
    категории \"Дориан\". Ожидается, что стихия достигнет штата Флорида 1 сентября
    2019 года с порывом  ветра от 135  до 157 км/ч.\n\nВ соответствии с  рекомендацией
    властей штата Флорида просим Вас  запастись продовольствием, водой и лекарствами
    на семь дней, а также подготовить план действий на случай стихийного бедствия.\n\n<span
    class=\"underline\">Сообщаем, что посольством открыта горячая линия, по которой
    граждане РК могут получить необходимую консультативную помощь:</span><br>\n<a
    href=\"tel:2022325488\">(202)232-5488</a> ext 122;   \n<a href=\"mailto:consuldc16@gmail.com?Subject=Hurricane&Dorian&Assistance\"
    target=\"_top\">consuldc16@gmail.com</a>.\n \n\n### Также, рекомендуем изучить
    меры безопасности при сильном ветре и действия при штормовом предупреждении:\n\n####
    Что делать, если поступило штормовое предупреждение?\n\n1. Плотно закройте и укрепите
    все двери и окна. На стекла наклейте крест-накрест полоски пластыря (чтобы не
    разлетались осколки).\n2. Подготовьте запас воды и пищи, медикаментов, фонарик,
    свечи, керосиновую лампу, приемник на батарейках, документы и деньги.\n3. Отключите
    газ и электричество.\n4. Уберите с балконов ( дворов) предметы, которые могут
    быть унесены ветром.\n5. Из легких зданий перейдите в более прочные или убежища
    гражданской обороны.\n6. Держитесь подальше от берега моря и рек.\n7. Если у вас
    есть машина, постарайтесь отъехать как можно дальше от эпицентра урагана. \n\n####
    Если вы оказались на улице во время урагана\n1. Держитесь подальше от зданий и
    строений, высоких столбов, деревьев, рекламных щитов, мачт, опор и электропроводов.\n2.
    Нельзя находиться на мостах, путепроводах, эстакадах, в местах хранения легковоспламеняющихся
    и ядовитых веществ.\n3. Спрячьтесь под мостом, железобетонным навесом, в подвале,
    погребе. Можно лечь в яму или любое углубление. Глаза, рот и нос защитите от песка
    и земли.\n4. Нельзя залезать на крышу и прятаться на чердаке.\n5. Если вы едете
    на машине по равнине, остановитесь, но не покидайте автомобиль. Плотнее закройте
    его двери и окна.\n6. Если вы в городском транспорте, немедленно покиньте его
    и ищите убежище.\n7. Если стихия застигла вас на возвышенном или открытом месте,
    бегите (при необходимости ползите) в сторону какого-либо укрытия (к скалам, лесу),
    которое могло бы погасить силу ветра, но берегитесь падающих веток и деревьев.\n8.
    Когда ветер стих, не выходите сразу из укрытия, так как через несколько минут
    шквал может повториться.\n9. Сохраняйте спокойствие и не паникуйте, помогайте
    пострадавшим.\n \n#### Как вести себя после стихийных бедствий\n1. Выходя из укрытия,
    осмотритесь – нет ли нависающих предметов и частей конструкций, оборванных проводов.\n2.
    Не зажигайте газ и огонь, не включайте электричество до тех пор, пока специальные
    службы не проверят состояние коммуникаций.\n3. Не пользуйтесь лифтом.\n4. Не заходите
    в поврежденные строения, не подходите к оборванным электропроводам.\n5. Взрослое
    население оказывает помощь спасателям."

  body: "Mr. President Nazerbayev, Mr. President Tokayev, ladies and gentlemen, \n\nI’m
    happy to be again in Nur Sultan for an event that confirm the role ofKazakhstan
    as a key world player for peace, security, stability, the biggestlegacies for
    the younger generations.A world free from nuclear weapons is the precondition
    to achieve lastingand comprehensive peace. \n\nMany in the world share these important
    goal.Unfortunately there are still some very concerning situations where worldpeace
    is at stake: unclear stance from the North Korean leader Kim onstopping once and
    forever building nuclear arsenals; growing tensions inmiddle east, linked to the
    issue of Iran nuclear proliferation and to thedifficulties to reengage Teheran
    in a clear, verifiable path towards a clearno to nuclear bombs; serious potential
    repercussions, if Iran goes ahead, on other regional players like Saudi Arabia
    and Israel, with the risk of avicious circle of proliferation. \n\nTrump’s United
    States and Russia are escalating on disengaging from theinternational binding
    agreements, instead of working together for globalsecurity, as it should be. Europe,
    although strongly supporting non proliferation and peace, is too weak and little
    relevant on international issue.With the award of today we pay tribute first of
    all to the first president of Kazakstan Mr. Nursultan Nazerbayev, who took first
    after the dissolution of Soviet Union the historical decision to dismantle unilaterally
    nuclear arsenals located on his territory, despite, I’m sure, strong criticism
    from Moscow at that time. Those who are awarded have proven to follow the visionary
    path of fightingnuclear proliferation and bringing together states and people
    to destroy allthe nuclear weapons. \n\nThe lesson learned: we need leadership
    to achieve historical results butalso to adopt historical decisions. This is why
    rightly this price for world peace is named to President Nazarbayev, and rightly
    those who won the award are persons whose lifehas been devoted to non proliferation
    and peace."

  body: "Remarks by the Executive Secretary\nPreparatory Commission for the\nComprehensive
    Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\nDr Lassina Zerbo\n\nAward Ceremony of the
    “Nazarbayev Prize for a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World and Global Security”\n \nNur-Sultan
    \n\n29 August 2019\n\nYour Excellency Nursultan Nazarbayev, the First President
    of the Republic of Kazakhstan – Elbasy, \nYour Excellency Kassym-Jomart Tokayev,
    Mr President, \nExcellencies, dear Friends, \n\nIt is a great honour to be awarded
    the Nazarbayev Prize for a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World and Global Security together
    with the late Director General of the IAEA Yukiya Amano. \n\nIn receiving this
    distinguished award, I find myself filled with many emotions. It is a distinct
    privilege to be recognized for my efforts to enhance global peace and security.
    But I am also filled with sadness as I continue to mourn a friend, ally, and partner
    in our shared objectives of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
    achieving the security of a world free from nuclear weapons. Let’s cherish his
    memory and acknowledge his remarkable service towards our common cause. \n\nAlthough
    it may seem as a distant reality, a nuclear-weapons-free world cannot exist without
    a nuclear-test-free world. And who could attest to this better than the First
    President of the Republic of Kazakhstan? \nOn 29 August 1991, thanks to his courage
    and commitment to global peace and security, the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site
    was permanently closed. Leading by example, Kazakhstan also voluntarily renounced
    the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world. The Polygon, one of the Soviet
    Union’s two major test sites, became a prominent venue for research on the peaceful
    use of nuclear energy. \n\nThis experience has given Kazakhstan an added sense
    of purpose and responsibility pushing for a total ban on nuclear tests. \nI would
    like to express my full-hearted gratitude to Kazakhstan and to Elbasy personally
    for what he has done over the years. You have ensured that Kazakhstan remains
    a moral leader in the quest for a world free of nuclear weapons.  \n\nLet me also
    express my heartfelt thanks for your acceptance to join the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
    Treaty Organization’s Group of Eminent Persons and to lead the CTBTO initiative
    “Champions of a nuclear test free world for a nuclear weapons free world”. Your
    commitment and experience will be invaluable in achieving the CTBT entry into
    force. \nLadies and gentlemen, \n\nThis ceremony takes place on a highly symbolic
    day. 29 August is the International Day against Nuclear Tests. \n\nSince the early
    days of the atomic age, the United States, the USSR and other countries recognized
    that ending explosive nuclear testing globally was absolutely vital to halting
    the proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, it took nearly 50 years to finally
    initiate negotiations on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \n\nToday,
    the entry into force of the CTBT is more crucial than ever for maintain global
    security. And here I would like to thank President Tokayev and the Government
    of Kazakhstan for their unwavering support for the Treaty. \nLet us ensure that
    the much needed entry into force of the CTBT is achieved as early as possible.
    \n\n29 August marks the International Day against Nuclear Tests. However, let
    me assure you, we will continue to work hard to make sure that not only today,
    but every day, is a day against nuclear tests.\nThe CTBT is also an important
    confidence building measure, ensuring that no nuclear test goes undetected, and
    providing a basis for continuing dialogue and expanding cooperation. In the context
    of the NPT, the Treaty serves as a common denominator for the NWS and NNWS.\n\nExcellencies,
    dear Friends, \nWith uncertainty and insecurity clouding the international political
    arena, it has become all the more important to advance the Treaty and ensure it
    enters into force.\n\nA permanent and verifiable end to nuclear testing will serve
    as a significant stepping stone towards nuclear disarmament. This is what I have
    committed to pursuing, and what I will continue to fight for in the years to come.\nWe
    must finish what we started. We owe it to all people who devoted themselves to
    this cause, and to the future generations for whose security we must fight for.
    \ Thank you."

  body: "H.E.Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev, The First President,\nH.E.Kassym-Jomart
    Tokayev, The President, \nDistinguished Guests,\nLadies & Gentlemen,\n\nMy elder
    brother Yukiya passed away on July 18.\n Before he died, he was told that he was
    chosen as the awardees of this highly prestigious Prize, and he was truly pleased
    with this great honour.\n\nThroughout his career, he had a number of occasions
    on which he had the pleasure of meeting with the First President. He was deeply
    impressed and moved by the determination and passion of the First President towards
    the nuclear disarmament and its elimination from the Earth. He immediately came
    to pay high respect to him. From time to time, he told us that he has a good chemistry
    with President Nazarbayev, whom he felt as a true comrade. \n \nIn mid-June my
    brother came to Japan to have yet another medical check, and the results were
    not at all good. Since then he came to wish to survive till the International
    Day against Nuclear Tests so that he can come to Nur-sultan to attend this ceremony,
    and to see the First President once again.\n \nMy brother served as a Japanese
    diplomat for nearly 40 years. In the autumn of 1994, Mr. Yohei Kohno, then Foreign
    Minister of Japan and the father of current Foreign Minister, took an initiative
    to propose a completely new UN resolution on total   elimination of nuclear weapons.
    Triggered by the experience of drafting this resolution, my brother found the
    issue of nuclear disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons his life-long
    mission.\n\nFortunately, this resolution on total elimination of nuclear weapons
    has been adopted by the UN General Assembly for 25 consecutive years now with
    only small modifications year after year.\n \nI will not continue on my brother’s
    contributions in the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation since many of you
    here knows about it.\nAs a Japanese diplomat myself, I take high pride in my brother.
    At the same time, I feel a bit jealous of him, because he was able to find an
    area of expertise that is worth spending one’s whole life. \n \nThanks to your
    friendship, he could complete his life very happily. For that, I thank you on
    his behalf. "

  body: "I am immensely proud to be travelling to New York to head Kazakhstan’s delegation
    to the United Nations General Assembly. It will be my first visit as president
    but I am, of course, no stranger – as a former foreign minister – to either the
    United States or the UN, where I served as under-secretary general.\n\nI hope
    this experience will be valuable as I work to build on the legacy of our first
    president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who led our country with such distinction. It
    is my task as his successor to continue the remarkable progress he made both domestically
    and in Kazakhstan’s contribution internationally.\n\nIndeed, my election in June
    underlines how far our country has come over the last 30 years. After President
    Nazarbayev decided to step down earlier this year, the peaceful transfer of power
    and competitive elections show both that democracy has taken root and that the
    desire of the Kazakh people is for continued development. It is a goal I am determined
    we will reach.\n\nIn my first State of the Nation address earlier this month,
    I put an emphasis on accelerating political reform and on improving human rights
    and the quality of life. I set out the ambition of a truly modern state which
    is both accountable and responsive to the needs of its citizens. My intention
    is to build up a state that listens but also, what is more important, hears the
    voices of its citizens.\n\nThe new National Council of Public Trust, which has
    representatives from across Kazakhstan’s society, has been established to help
    build a genuine dialogue about the further path of reforms.\n\nBuilding a more
    responsive state is also important for our goals to speed up economic development
    and spread prosperity widely. Our economy – and the standard of living of our
    people – has been transformed over the last three decades. But I believe the continued
    growth and modernization of our economy cannot be sustained without continued
    political reform and the active involvement of all our people in decision-making.\n\nA
    major factor, too, in the transformation of our economy into the most successful
    in Central Asia has been Kazakhstan’s openness to foreign investment and partnership.
    I want to improve the investment climate further and make sure our international
    partners feel secure and comfortable doing business in our country.\n\nThese partners
    include more than 700 American companies which rightly see Kazakhstan as the region’s
    commercial hub. They include Nasdaq and Goldman Sachs, which have become shareholders
    in the Astana International Exchange. Major American tech companies have joined
    Kazakhstan’s efforts to usher our country into the fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nThese
    business links have strengthened since the Enhanced Strategic Partnership between
    our two countries was signed in January 2018. Last year the inflow of U.S. investment
    in the Kazakh economy increased by 45 percent. I want to see more American companies
    and investors engaged in an economy and business climate already unmatched in
    our region and which a series of recent financial studies have found is heading
    in the right direction. \n\nThe links between our two countries, of course, go
    far beyond the economy. We have built a close partnership with the U.S. and cooperated
    closely on many important foreign policy issues. This will not change. Under my
    leadership, Kazakhstan will continue the constructive, balanced and independent
    foreign policy we have followed so successfully over the last three decades.\n\nIt
    is an approach which has at its heart a determination to promote peace, dialogue
    and cooperation wherever we can and to deepen the connections between our region
    and the wider world. Strongly committed to a better future for Central Asia, Kazakhstan
    offers cooperation with its partners and allies in trade, investment, communication,
    infrastructure and security. Through geography and our values, Kazakhstan is uniquely
    positioned to act as a bridge between East and West – a responsibility we take
    very seriously. Kazakhstan has, for example, actively supported the reconstruction
    of Afghanistan through mediation, investment and aid programs. The Astana International
    Financial Center (AIFC) is also helping spread prosperity across the region.\n\nOn
    the global stage, we will continue to argue for the widest possible dialogue to
    tackle global problems and to champion the cause of nuclear non-proliferation.
    After voluntarily giving up the nuclear arsenal we inherited from the Soviet Union,
    Kazakhstan has shown that security and influence do not depend on these weapons.
    We use our experience to encourage other countries to follow our lead and to work
    toward a world which will eventually be free of nuclear weapons.\n\nUnfortunately,
    the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty risks leading the
    world again down the path of nuclear proliferation. Through multilateral talks,
    building trust and continued cooperation with international partners, we can reverse
    this trend and, in time, eventually eliminate this threat to humanity’s survival.
    We will do all we can to encourage dialogue, ease suspicions and build confidence
    on this and other global challenges.   \n\nKazakhstan is entering a new era –
    one of reform and continued progress. I am confident, with the help of our allies
    and partners, that our country has a bright future and will continue to be a force
    for good in the world.\n\n*Kassym-Jomart Tokayev became president of Kazakhstan
    on March 20. He previously was chairman of the national Senate from 2007 to 2011
    and from 2013 until ascending to the presidency. He was Kazakhstan’s prime minister
    from 1999 to 2002 and director-general of the United Nations’ office in Geneva,
    2011 to 2013.*\n\nSource: [The Hill](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/462222-kazakhstan-will-continue-championing-dialogue-and)"

  - Prepared Remarks & Speeches
  body: "*Adopted on September 24, 2019 in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan*\n\n We, the participants
    of the 4th Meeting of Speakers of the Eurasian Countries’ Parliaments under the
    theme of “Greater Eurasia: Dialogue. Trust. Partnership”,\n \n1.\tWe share a common
    vision of the future of Eurasia as a single space of peace, cooperation and interaction,
    common values and equal opportunities, and we express our readiness to promote
    a committed and open dialogue about the present and future of the Eurasian continent.\n2.\tWe
    note the special role of legislative authorities of the countries of Europe and
    Asia in supporting the activities of regional integration associations for the
    purpose of a comprehensive partnership based on the principles of respect for
    equality, consideration of mutual interests, and, in this regard, we emphasize
    the importance of improving inter-parliamentary cooperation.\n4.\tWe note the
    historical contribution of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan
    Nazarbayev as the author and initiator of the Eurasian idea and a number of successful
    integration economic institutions in the Eurasian space; we support the concept
    of Greater Eurasia and welcome the Three Dialogues initiative put forward by the
    First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev to meet the
    common interests of all Eurasian states in peace, stability and security.\n5.\tWe
    consider the search for joint responses to modern challenges and threats, as well
    as the harmonization of the geo-economic interests and ensuring greater connectivity
    of Eurasian countries, as the main elements in the formation of a common growth
    space in Eurasia, realizing a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable
    and stable trade and investment environment.\n6.\tWe believe that forming a system
    of constructive and non-confrontational interaction between the countries of Eurasia
    based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, and vital
    interests; non-interference; renunciation of threats, pressure and militant rhetoric;
    and compliance with the international law, purposes and principles of the UN Charter
    can give a powerful impetus to the further development of pan-Eurasian space,
    as well as to accelerate the economic growth in Eurasia.\n \n6.\tWe confirm the
    relevance of legislative support for achieving the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals combining the efforts in the field of water, air, energy, food and environmental
    security including maritime environment and ecosystem, as well as in solving the
    most acute social problems in the regional and global dimensions.\n7.\tWe affirm
    our invariable commitment to supporting dynamism, inclusivity of the development
    processes in Eurasia and building a prosperous, people-centered and sustainable
    space in the face of challenges; as well as our commitment to working together
    in implementing projects and programs of cooperation, expanding interregional
    ties, improving legal framework and contacts in various areas of interaction across
    the entire spectrum of bilateral and multilateral relations.\n8.\tWe consider
    it necessary to coordinate the efforts of parliamentarians in matters of digitalization,
    ensuring digital sovereignty, protecting the rights of citizens in the digital
    space, as well as innovative development of economies for the environmentally
    safe, sustainable and balanced development of Eurasian states.\n9.\tWe underscore
    the relevance of cooperation in disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation
    of nuclear weapons, as well as the peaceful use of atomic energy. We call on parliaments
    to effectively participate in building a nuclear weapon free world.\n10.\tWe share
    a common view that achieving complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula
    and establishing a permanent peace regime will contribute to the peace and prosperity
    of the Eurasian region and beyond, and express our support for resolving North
    Korea’s nuclear issues through dialogue.\n11.\tWe condemn terrorism in all its
    forms and manifestations as one of the major threats to the human community and
    sustainable development, and express our resolute intention to strengthen and
    develop inter-parliamentary cooperation in the fight against terrorism in accordance
    with the UN Charter and the principles of international law, without political
    egoism and double standards, respecting sovereignty and independence of the states
    of the continent and the whole world, to seek a convergence of views of our countries
    on this issue.\n12.\tRecognizing the gravity of the situation with refugees in
    Eurasia fraught with major political, social, economic and, especially, humanitarian
    consequences, we call for more effective, concerted efforts of the international
    community in jointly addressing this problem.\n \n13.\tWe stand for consolidated
    efforts against the use of information, communication and any new technologies
    to destabilize security on the continent, promote the ideas of terrorism, separatism,
    extremism, racial and religious intolerance in the Internet space. We call for
    the continued cooperation in ensuring information and cyber security.\n14.\tWe
    emphasize the need to develop cultural and humanitarian ties to strengthen cooperation,
    trust and mutual understanding between the peoples living in Eurasia.\n15.\tWe
    advocate for the further development of inter-civilizational, inter-cultural and
    inter-religious dialogue, including through the spreading and using of the practices
    and experience of the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions and
    similar initiatives and forums, and support the message of the Document on “Humanitarian
    Fraternity for World Peace and Coexistence” signed by the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar
    and the Pope of the Catholic Church in February 2019 in the United Arab Emirates.\n16.\tWe
    appraise the positive outcomes of the 140th Inter-Parliamentary Union’s General
    Assembly and the Related Meetings that were successfully hosted by the State of
    Qatar during the period from 6th to 10th of April, 2019.\n17.\tWe express our
    deep gratitude to the Mazhilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan
    for the hospitality and successful holding of the 4th Meeting of Speakers of Eurasian
    Countries’ Parliaments in the capital of Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan.\n18.\tWe reached
    an agreement to hold the 5th Meeting of Speakers of Eurasian Countries’ Parliaments
    in 2020 in Indonesia.\n"

    3-5 октября 2019 года в г.Вашингтон состоялась выставка казахстанских ремесленников  «Kazakhstan: Soul of Tengri». Мероприятие проходило под эгидой Смитсоновского института в рамках выставки «Smithsonian Craft2Wear Show», которая является престижной площадкой прикладного искусства и экспонирует работы уникальных художников и дизайнеров США и всего мира.

    Впервые мероприятие такого высокого уровня состоялось в National Building Museum, который считается историческим наследием г.Вашингтон.

    Целью участия Казахстана на выставке стало ознакомление американской публики с декоративно-прикладным искусством и культурой казахского народа в рамках реализации программы «Рухани Жаңғыру» и «Семь граней Великой степи».

    В своей приветственной речи Посол РК в США Е.Казыханов подчеркнул важность организации и проведения подобных проектов в контексте укрепления сотрудничества в сфере культуры, позволяющие больше узнать о традициях, истории и обычаях наших народов через искусство. Данные площадки позволяют рассказать о мировоззрении и ценностях народов Великой степи, кочевой культуре и фрагментах исторической хроники казахского народа.

    При поддержке Посольства РК в США на выставке были представлены работы более 10 казахстанских мастеров в сфере прикладного искусства (ювелирные изделия, уникальные предметы декора, аксессуары, одежда из войлока), что вызвало большой интерес среди посетителей и участников мероприятия. Также казахстанский художник и дизайнер А.Беккулова представила свою коллекцию в рамках организованного показа модной одежды «Fashion Show».

    Кроме того, в ходе данного мероприятия 4 октября т.г. состоялся симпозиум на тему «Kazakhstan’s Crafts and Creative Economy» с участием представителей Государственного музея искусств имени А.Кастеева и Азиатской культурной программы Смитсоновского института, в ходе которого ученые и исследователи отечественного музея выступили с докладами по истории и наследию и аспектам казахского декоративно-прикладного искусства.

  body: "16 октября т.г.  состоялась официальная церемония открытия офиса Генерального
    консульства Казахстана в г. Сан-Франциско.  Казахстан стал первой страной Центральной
    Азии, открывшей свое дипломатическое представительство на Западном побережье США.
    \n\nВо многом, это стало возможно благодаря договоренностям, достигнутым на высшем
    уровне в ходе официального визита Елбасы в Вашингтон в январе 2018 года, где стороны
    приняли заявление о расширенном стратегическом партнерстве между Казахстаном и
    США в 21 веке. \n\nПоздравить Казахстан со столь знаменательным событием собрались
    высокие представители Офиса зарубежных миссий Государственного департамента США,
    офиса губернатора штата Калифорния, мэрии г. Сан-Франциско, а также руководство
    крупных американских компаний, расположенных в Кремниевой долине. \n\nВ своем
    поздравлении мэр г. Сан-Франциско Лондон Брид отметила, что \"с энтузиазмом приветствует
    открытие Генерального консульства Казахстана, призванное расширить казахстанско-американское
    сотрудничество\". Директор Офиса зарубежных миссий Государственного департамента
    США Мэттью Дэвис подчеркнул, что \"наши страны продолжают укреплять взаимодействие
    по всему спектру вопросов и открытие Генконсульства Казахстана на Западном побережье
    является прямым результатом совместной  плодотворной работы\". \n\nВыступая перед
    гостями мероприятия, Посол Казахстана в США Ержан Казыханов поблагодарил мэра
    г. Сан-Франциско Лондон Брид, офис губернатора шт. Калифорния, Государственный
    департамент США за теплые пожелания по случаю открытия Генерального консульства
    РК, а также с удовлетворением отметил высокую динамику развития торгово-инвестиционных
    связей между нашими странами. Кроме того, пригласил гостей мероприятия посетить
    выступления \"Astana Ballet\" в  крупнейших городах шт. Калифорния, включая г.
    Сан-Франциско \n19-22 ноября т.г. для ознакомления с культурным наследием великой
    степи.\n\nВ рамках своего рабочего визита по случаю открытия Генконсульства в
    г. \nСан - Франциско, Посол Ержан Казыханов посетил Кремниевую долину, где провел
    переговоры с рукодством  компаний Plug&Play и  CISCO. \n\nПо итогам переговоров
    с Генеральным директором «Plug&Play» Саидом Амиди достигнута договоренность об
    открытии энергетического инновационного  хаба «Plug and Play» в 2020 году в г.
    Нур-Султан для осуществления трансферта технологии и инноваций в Казахстан.  Компания
    подтвердила участие на международном форуме «Digital Bridge» в г. Нур-Султан 24-25
    октября 2019 года.\n\nПо итогам переговоров с вице-президентом компании «Cisco»
    Гаем Гидрихом достигнута договоренность о предоставения на безвозмездной основе
    учебной программы по информационным технологиям и кибербезопасности в рамках программы
    «Цифровой Казахстан». \n\nВажным пунктом программы также стала организация круглого
    стола совместно с Американо-казахстанской деловой ассоциацией, которая в этом
    году отмечает свое 20-летие. В работе круглого стола приняли участие представители
    таких технических гигантов, как «Cisco», «Chevron», «Plug and Play», «500 Startups»,
    «Primus Power», «Valmont», «MinIO», «Nutanix» и др. На круглом столе презентована
    программа «Цифровой Казахстан», возможность реализации совместных проектов в рамках
    «Kazakhstan Investment Development Fund». Особое внимание было также уделено отечественным
    \ ИТ-компаниям, расположенным в Кремниевой долине и установлению контактов между
    казахстанскими стартапами и американскими корпорациями. \n  \nОткрытие Генконсульства
    РК в г.Сан-Франциско позволит оказывать консульские услуги казахстанцам на Западном
    побережье США. Так, в ходе визита в здании Генконсульства РК состоялась встреча
    с молодыми казахстанцами, работающими в Кремниевой долине в компаниях Google,
    Epam, Motrux LLC и др., а также со студентами, обучающимися по программе \"Болашак\"
    в престижных университетах  Калифорнии  - Стэнфорд, Беркли и др. Примечательно,
    что среди гостей были многие казахстанцы, приехавшие на данную встречу из соседних
    городов, включая г. Лос-Анджелес. Казахстанцы приветствовали открытие Генерального
    консульства и с удовлетворением отметили, что благодаря  дипломатическим усилиям
    Казахстана, стало возможным поддерживать связь с Родиной и соотечественниками.

    The international project to establish the [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-leu-bank-becomes-operational-with-delivery-of-low-enriched-uranium) Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank in Kazakhstan was successfully implemented at the initiative of the First President of Kazakhstan, Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev.

    The IAEA LEU Bank will store 90 metric tons of uranium hexafluoride suitable to produce fuel for a standard light-water reactor at nuclear power plants. This reserve of LEU is not a radioactive waste, does not pose a threat to the population and the environment and will be used in case IAEA Member States are faced with the cessation of traditional fuel supplies for political reasons.

    Thanks to the investments of Kazakhstan and the IAEA, the necessary infrastructure for the safe storage of material has been created on the basis of the Ulba Metallurgical Plant, which has many years of experience in this area.

    The IAEA LEU Bank is an important contribution of Kazakhstan and a confirmation of its leading role in strengthening international security and nuclear non-proliferation.

    The suppliers of material for the IAEA LEU Bank are the Kazakhstan company NAC Kazatomprom JSC and the French company Orano Cycle.

    The signing of documents between Kazakhstan and the IAEA on the establishment of the IAEA LEU Bank took place in August 2015 in the Kazakh capital during the visit of the IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano.

    September 27, 2019
    New York

    World War II broke out on September 1, 1939 and claimed the lives of tens of millions of people. This was the worst tragedy of the 20th century. This catastrophe was primarily the result of the aggressive aspirations of those who were convinced of their own racial exceptionality and superiority. An indisputable fact is that throughout the 1930s, the Soviet Union had consistently advocated the creation of a pan-European system of mutual obligations and guarantees designed to prevent a global military conflict.

    Having shown unprecedented heroic resistance, the peoples of the Soviet Union not only stood up to a strong enemy in a fierce battle, but, at the cost of their lives, saved the future of all humankind and the world civilisation. In victorious 1945, the world looked with admiration and sincere appreciation at the liberating soldiers.

    Our common duty is to preserve and firmly uphold the historical truth about those events, honour and pass on through generations the memory of the lessons and victims of World War II and everyone who fought Nazism and fascism in the name of independence, salvation from enslavement and the destruction of entire countries and nations, respect for human dignity, and the triumph of the ideals of freedom, equality and fraternity.

    We, the descendants of the heroes of that war, cannot allow anyone to falsify or distort historical facts for the sake of their fleeting political interests. Based on mandatory compliance with the decisions of the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, which do not have a statute of limitations, we strongly condemn any attempts to revise the causes of World War II. We consider particularly dangerous the ideas that not only pander to xenophobia and intolerance, but, at the state level, cultivate the idea of their own superiority. The justification and glorification of cruelty and inhumanity will inevitably revive the ideology of fascism and Nazism, regardless of geographical or cultural and historical realities.

    The most important outcome of World War II was the decision to establish the
    United Nations as a universal international organisation to maintain international peace and security, and to develop an equal dialogue between member states. We express our willingness to support an international system based on collective principles in resolving international conflicts, the supremacy of international law, primarily the provisions of the UN Charter , with the central and coordinating role of the UN in international relations.

    We call for supporting the resolution of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, “Combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,” including the proposal to recognise the Victory over Nazism in World War II as the world heritage of humankind, and monuments to the fighters against Nazism in all countries as the world memorial of humankind.

  body: "«27» сентября 2019 года\tг. \nНью-Йорк\n\nВторая мировая война, начавшаяся
    1 сентября 1939 года и унесшая жизни десятков миллионов человек, стала величайшей
    трагедией XX века. Эта катастрофа стала, прежде всего, результатом агрессивных
    устремлений тех, кто был убежден в собственной расовой исключительности и превосходстве.
    При этом неоспоримым фактом является то, что на протяжении всех 1930-х годов Советский
    Союз последовательно выступал за создание общеевропейской системы взаимных обязательств
    и гарантий, призванной предотвратить возникновение глобального военного конфликта.
    \n\nНароды СССР, оказав беспримерное героическое сопротивление, не только выстояли
    в чудовищной схватке с врагом, но и ценой своих жизней спасли будущее всего человечества
    и мировой цивилизации. В победном \n1945 году мир с восхищением и искренней признательностью
    смотрел на воинов-освободителей. \n\nНаш общий долг - хранить и твердо отстаивать
    историческую правду о тех событиях, чтить и передавать через поколения память
    об уроках и жертвах Второй мировой войны, о каждом, кто боролся с нацизмом и фашизмом
    во имя независимости, спасения от порабощения и уничтожения целых стран и народов,
    уважения человеческого достоинства, торжества идеалов свободы, равенства и братства.\n\nМы
    – потомки героев той войны, не можем позволить фальсифицировать и искажать исторические
    факты в угоду политической конъюнктуре. Исходя из обязательности неукоснительного
    соблюдения решений Международного военного трибунала в Нюрнберге, не имеющих срока
    давности, решительно осуждаем любые попытки пересмотра причин Второй мировой войны.
    Считаем особенно опасными те мировоззренческие установки, которые не только потакают
    ксенофобии и нетерпимости, но и на государственном уровне культивируют идею собственного
    превосходства. Оправдывание и героизация жестокости и бесчеловечности неизбежно
    реанимируют идеологию фашизма и нацизма вне зависимости от географических и культурно-исторических
    реалий.\n\nВажнейшим итогом Второй мировой войны стало решение об учреждении Организации
    Объединенных Наций в качестве универсальной международной организации в целях
    поддержания международного мира и безопасности, развития равноправного диалога
    между государствами – членами. Выражаем готовность поддерживать международную
    систему, основанную на коллективных началах в решении международных проблем, на
    верховенстве международного права, прежде всего, на положениях Устава ООН при
    ее центральной координирующей роли в международных отношениях.\n\nПризываем поддержать
    резолюцию 74-й сессии Генеральной Ассамблеи ООН «Борьба с героизацией нацизма,
    неонацизма и другими видами практики, которые способствуют эскалации современных
    форм расизма, расовой дискриминации, ксенофобии и связанной с ними нетерпимости»,
    в том числе предложение признать Победу над нацизмом во Второй мировой войне всемирным
    наследием человечества, а памятники борцам с нацизмом во всех странах – всемирным
    мемориалом человечества.\n\nМинистр иностранных дел Республики Армения\nМинистр
    иностранных дел Кыргызской Республики \nМинистр иностранных дел Республики Беларусь\nМинистр
    иностранных дел Российской Федерации\nМинистр иностранных дел Республики Казахстан\t\nМинистр
    иностранных дел Республики Таджикистан\n"

  nb_body: The Aleph Jewish Ethno Cultural Centre in Nur-Sultan organised a celebration
    of Hanukkah and invited a reporter from The Astana Times to talk about the holiday
    and community. The Aleph Jewish Centre was established in 1993 by a group of teachers
    and other culture workers and was one of the first to become part of the Assembly

  title: Nuclear Nonproliferation & Security
  body: "All facets of modern Kazakhstan and national identity have been shaped by
    its [history](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/kazakhstan-nuclear-disarmament/)with
    nuclear weapons. The lives of all Kazakhs have in some way been singed by nuclear
    testing. The former Soviet Union treated Kazakh soil as a nuclear testing ground
    and conducted as many as 460 nuclear tests. \n\nKazakhstan inherited upon independence
    more than 1400 nuclear weapons, and President Nazarbayev quickly moved to decommission
    each warhead and tactical weapon. Today Kazakhstan stands as an clear example
    of how a nation can obtain economic prosperity and national security without nuclear
    weapons, rather than with them. \n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan’s contribution
    to the nuclear disarmament program demonstrates its commitment to the objectives
    of global security, establishing Kazakhstan as a critical member of the world
    community.  \n\n<div class=\"usa-alert usa-alert-info\">\n<div class=\"usa-alert-body\">\n<h3
    class=\"usa-alert-heading\">Nuclear Threat Initiative; Washington, D.C</h3>\n<p
    class=\"usa-alert-text\">Kazakhstan’s experience in disarming itself of nuclear
    weapons following the fall of the Soviet Union could serve as a model for other
    countries, most notably Iran. During a symposium held here on Capitol Hill, Kazakh
    and U.S. officials, former officials and other experts detailed Kazakhstan’s transformation
    during the 1990s from a newly independent country possessing one of the world’s
    largest nuclear arsenals to one that renounced nuclear weapons and has since worked
    to dismantle its Soviet-era WMD architecture with U.S. assistance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n
    \   \nOn the 29th of December 1991, the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia
    and Ukraine signed the Almaty Declaration, in which they agreed on the control
    mechanisms over the operation of the nuclear arsenal of the former USSR and affirmed
    their international obligations concerning the strategic arms reduction.\n\nOn
    the 23rd of May 1992, in Lisbon the representatives of Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine,
    Russia and USA signed a five party Protocol to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
    At the same time Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, as the states possessing nuclear
    weapons, committed themselves to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thus Kazakhstan
    has made a historical decision to renounce its nuclear heritage which was an important
    step strengthening the statehood of our country as an integral part of existing
    world civilization.\n\nIn accordance with the Lisbon Protocol, Kazakhstan, Belarus
    and Ukraine, as successor states to the USSR in terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction
    Treaty, have agreed to participate, along with Russia and USA, in the work of
    the joint Commission on observance and inspection. They have also agreed to conclude
    agreements on the limits and restrictions specified by the Treaty. Kazakhstan
    ratified the Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, which is an integral part of the
    Treaty, on the 2nd of July 1992. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty came into
    force in 1994 and paved the way to disarmament and the elimination of more than
    9,000 nuclear warheads under strict supervision.\n\nKazakhstan was the first among
    the participants of the Lisbon Protocol to implement the provisions concerning
    removal of nuclear warheads. On the 21st of April 1996 the process of removal
    of 1416 nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan territory was completed. On the 30th
    of May 1995 the last nuclear test warhead, which was located in a gallery on the
    Semipalatinsk test site, was destroyed. Finally Kazakhstan had got rid of its
    nuclear inheritance forever.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, Kazakhstan was the site
    of the world’s fourth largest nuclear arsenal of more than 1000 deadly ICBMs which
    posed a menacing, if not dangerous, threat to international peace, depending on
    the leadership and direction of that country when it became independent in 1991.
    Fortunately, that leader was President Nursultan Nazarbayev who acted decisively
    to order the dismantling and removal of the country’s entire nuclear weapons system.
    \n\nIn 1994, Kazakhstan transferred more than a half-ton of weapons-grade uranium
    to the U.S. In 1995, Kazakhstan removed its last nuclear warhead and, with U.S.
    assistance, completed the sealing of 181 nuclear test tunnels in May 2000. Kazakhstan
    has signed the START Treaty (1992), the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (1993),
    the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (2001).\n\nOn
    March, 21, 2009 the Treaty on Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in Central Asia, signed
    on September, 8, 2006 in Semei, Kazakhstan, went into force. Kazakhstan welcomes
    the Treaty’s becoming effective and believes that it will contribute to global
    non-proliferation process and promote regional and international security. The
    new denuclearized zone in Central Asia has a number of unique features. First,
    one of the zone’s state namely, Kazakhstan, in the past possessed the forth largest
    nuclear arsenal. Secondly, for the first time the denuclearized zone is created
    in Northern hemisphere. Thirdly, this Treaty becomes the first multilateral agreement
    in security area which brings together all five Central Asian countries. And finally,
    for the first time the denuclearized zone has been created in the region which
    borders upon two nuclear states. The Protocol on negative security assurances
    is an integral part of the Treaty. Under the Protocol, the nuclear weapon states
    pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any states member
    to the Treaty.\n\nOn June 18, 2009 over 25,000 locals, Kazakh dignitaries and
    world media gathered in Semey city to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's
    decision to stop nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site. The meeting was
    held in Semey where President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed an appeal to the
    international community to back up the peaceful mission of Kazakhstan. In his
    speech, President Nazarbayev emphasized that refusal to conduct nuclear testing
    has become possible due to courage and enthusiasm of millions of Kazakhs that
    put an end to the crimes against lives and health of the whole people of Kazakhstan.
    Besides he noted that “starting from the first days of the country’s independence,
    Kazakhstan did not leave its citizens alone with their problems. The work on social
    rehabilitation of the population and the territories suffered the harm of the
    nuclear tests is being constantly carried out. For these purposes the state utilized
    nearly KZT 34 billion (approximately $215 million)”.\n\nIn December 2009, the
    UN General Assembly unanimously accepted a resolution put forward by Kazakhstan
    proclaiming August 29, the day when in 1991 President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed
    a decree on the closure of Semipalatinsk Test Site, as the ‘International Day
    against Nuclear Tests’. Recognizing the negative impact of nuclear testing on
    human life and the environment, as well as the importance of ending nuclear tests
    as one of the key means of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world, the Resolution
    sets out to commemorate a significant date in Kazakhstan’s – and, indeed, - the
    world’s history.\n\nThe international community has fully appreciated Kazakhstan’s
    contribution to this nuclear disarmament program. Paying a visit to Kazakhstan
    in April 2010 U.N. Secretary General Ban Kim-moon said “I highly commend the extraordinary
    leadership of president Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who courageously closed this
    nuclear test site and initiated the nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Asia.
    That’s a big milestone”.\n\nDuring the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington,
    D.C. in April, 2010 Obama praised President Nazarbayev \"as really one of the
    model leaders in the world on nonproliferation and nuclear-safety issues\". U.S.
    President B. Obama and other leaders also took positive view on President Nazarbayev's
    proposition to establish an International Nuclear Fuel Bank on the Kazakh territory.
    President Nazarbayev highly appraised the antinuclear initiatives and achievements
    of the U.S. President in ensuring international security, namely, convocation
    of the Global Nuclear Security Summit, signing the New START Treaty with Russia,
    adoption of the new US nuclear posture review which had become a great step towards
    establishment of the nuclear-free world.\n\n "

  body: "Kazakhstan’s leadership in regional security cooperation has contributed
    to stability, peace and economic prosperity of the neighboring countries. The
    country has supported stabilization activities in Afghanistan and fought the common
    regional security threats, including nuclear proliferation, terrorism, trafficking
    in persons, narcotics, and organized crime as well as the newly emerging ones
    - climate change, food security, and water security. Kazakhstan has worked with
    the US since its independence in 1991 to advance the country’s capabilities to
    tackle these threats and ensure regional stability.\n\nKazakhstan has assumed
    a critical role as a regional leadership role in supporting the stabilization
    of Afghanistan. The country granted the overflight rights to coalition forces
    during operation Enduring Freedom and has since allowed for continued air and
    land transit for NATO ad US troops and equipment supplies to and from Afghanistan,
    effectively integrating into the Northern Distribution Network (NDN). In addition,
    Kazakhstan has played an important role in economic recovery of Afghanistan and
    efforts to integrate the country into the region within the US Department of State’s
    New Silk Road Initiative. \n\nThe government has established a $50 million scholarship
    program to educate one thousand Afghan students at Kazakhstan’s universities.
    It co-chaired the Istanbul Process, opened a trade office in Kabul, contributed
    to the sustainment of Afghan National Security forces, built infrastructure, and
    established KazAID – an aid agency focusing on Afghanistan and Central Asia. The
    infrastructure projects supported by the government include financing the construction
    of schools, hospitals, bridges, water supplies and the Kunduz-Talukan road. KazAID
    aims to render $2 million worth of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan in 2014."

      Kazakhstan is a participatory member of the United Nations, and fully supportive of the three main pillars of the United Nations - international peace and security, human well-being and humanitarian action, and sustainable development. 

      The Preamble to the Charter spells out that the United Nations was founded "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war". Kazakhstan is uniquely positioned to carry out this charter because of direct experiences in nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, protecting economic and social rights. Kazakhstan shares the imperative to make the Earth habitable for future generations free of conflicts stemming from food, water and energy crises. 

      Kazakhstan is transforming the city of Almaty into a sub-regional multilateral diplomacy and humanitarian hub with focus to enhance United Nations operations in the region and beyond.

    title: Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE)
    body: |
      Kazakhstan’s work with the OSCE has been broad and consistent to strengthen inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels. In its role as the 2010 OSCE Chairman-in-Office (CiO), the Republic of Kazakhstan followed the “Ministerial Troika” and a  “Quintet” format. Kazakhstan, the first non-European CiO, and paid specific attention to its Chairmanship agenda to the longstanding OSCE priorities, Democracy, Human rights, and Unresolved Conflicts. At the same time, Kazakhstan introduced its own agenda: 

      - __Security__ – Strengthening security in Central Asia is one of the most important priorities of Kazakhstan’s efforts within the OSCE. In addition, Kosovo’s independence can potentially help end unresolved conflicts in Transcaucasia (Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia) and other European regions (Crimea, Moldavia).
      - __Inter-religious tolerance__ – Kazakhstan will enhance international laws that strengthen inter-religious and ethnic tolerance within the OSCE’s zone of responsibility. Foreign Minister Tazhin’s 2008 commitments to cooperate with the OIC and OSCE also illustrate Kazakhstan’s determination in strengthening inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels.
      - __Energy security__ – In support of the European Union energy security agenda, Kazakhstan will strengthen alternative energy. This corresponds with the United States’ policies of energy security, such as the Clean Technology Fund, that focus on alternative energy and the development of clean energy technologies.

      background __\n\nThe idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President
      of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of the
      United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish
      an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the
      region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the world,
      for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier attempts
      for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the idea of convocation
      of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian states defining the political
      climate on the continent, and the international organizations (the United Nations,
      the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization of the initiative in 1993-1994 three
      meetings of the representatives of Foreign Ministries of Asian states were held.
      Following the results of the given meetings a Special Working Group (SWG) was
      established. The task of the Group includes preparation of documents for the
      meeting.\n\nPreparatory process. In 1993-1994 during the meetings of the representatives
      of the Asian countries’ MFA drafts of the CICA basic documents, i.e. “Rules
      of Procedure of the CICA”, “Declaration of the principles of mutual relations
      of the CICA Member States”, “Structure and institutions of the CICA”, were considered. 
      In 1996-1997, in Almaty, two meetings of Deputy Foreign Ministers of the CICA
      Member States were held.\nIn October 1998, in Almaty the international colloquium
      on the CICA issues, which was attended by 24 experts from 12 States took place.
      \n\n__The First CICA Ministerial Meeting__\n\nOn September 14, 1999 the First
      Ministerial Meeting was held. During this meeting the Declaration, regulating
      relations between the Member States of the meeting – a kind of a prototype of
      the legal framework for establishment of Asian security and cooperation system
      was signed.\n\nThus, for the first time the legal framework of the Asian security,
      with specific actions, measures and mechanisms to ensure stability in the region
      were laid. The First CICA Summit. On June 4, 2002 __the First summit of the
      Forum__, which brought together the heads of Kazakhstan, Russia, China, Pakistan,
      Turkey, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the Prime Ministers
      of Azerbaijan and India, the authorized officials of Iran, Egypt, Palestine
      and Israel, the representatives of States and observer organizations. During
      the Summit the Heads of States and Governments of the Conference agreed to provide
      the CICA with the necessary structure and institutions to improve the efficiency
      of its functioning and instructed the Foreign Ministers to finalize all aspects
      of establishment of the CICA Secretariat to provide administrative support for
      regular meetings and political consultations and other activities within the
      framework of the forum.\n\nAccording to the results the Almaty Act was signed
      and the Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting Dialogue among Civilizations
      was adopted. The Second CICA Ministerial Meeting. On October 22, 2004 __the
      Second Ministerial Meeting__, which resulted in the adoption of the Catalogue
      of Confidence Building Measures, Rules of Procedure and Declaration of the Second
      CICA Ministerial Meeting, was held. Admittance of the Kingdom of Thailand as
      the 17th CICA Member State on the eve of the event became another important
      event.\n\nAccording to the participants, the value of the adopted Catalogue
      of the Confidence Building Measures cannot be overestimated, since for the first
      time in the history of the Asian continent such a large-scale document that
      envisages multilateral cooperation between the countries on a wide range of
      issues of stability and security has appeared. The Declaration reflects the
      consolidated position of the vision and the CICA Member States on the key security
      issues in the world and the region. The heads of delegations stressed the need
      to develop a unified approach to solving the outstanding problems, directions
      of further cooperation in the context of confidence-building measures contained
      in the Catalogue.\n\n__The Second CICA Summit__\n\nOn June 17, 2006 the Second
      Summit of the Forum was held. During the Summit a comprehensive policy document
      – the Declaration of the second Summit was adopted and the basic document on
      practical structuring of the meeting – the Statute of the CICA Secretariat was
      signed. The Declaration reflects the common vision of the Member States on the
      key issues of security and cooperation in Asia and the in world on the whole,
      the proposals of the Member States on development of a universal approach to
      addressing unresolved issues, and the need for practical implementation of the
      CICA Confidence Building Measures which included in the Catalogue of Confidence
      Building Measures 2004, and the further development process was declared. On
      the same day, after signing of the relevant statutory document the CICA Secretariat
      was opened in Almaty. It is temporary located in the representative office of
      the MFA in Almaty.\nThe Third CICA Ministerial Meeting: The Third Ministerial
      Meeting held on August 25, 2008 in Almaty was attended by delegations of 19
      Member States, 7 observer-countries s and 6 international and regional organizations.
      A particular attention was paid to the practical implementation of the Cooperative
      approach. The meeting was productive enough: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
      and the United Arab Emirates were granted the full member status, and the State
      of Qatar joined the CICA as an observer. The Declaration “The CICA Progress
      in implementation of Confidence Building Measures” and the final decision of
      the Ministerial Meeting were adopted.\n\nThe Protocol on amendments of the Statute
      of the CICA Secretariat, providing for the transfer of the CICA Secretariat
      headquarters from Almaty to Astana was signed. President of the Republic of
      Kazakhstan, as the CICA Chairman, welcoming the start of executing confidence
      building measures in the human, economic and environmental dimensions as well
      as in combating new challenges and threats, spoke about the feasibility of implementation
      of practical work on development and strengthening cooperation in the military
      political dimension, which in the long run should become one of the most important
      areas of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures.\nThe Third CICA Summit.
      On June 8, 2010 in Istanbul the Third Summit of Heads of States and Governments
      of the CICA Member States was held. During the Summit for the first time in
      history of the Conference Chairmanship was transferred from the Republic of
      Kazakhstan to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n9 Heads of States and Governments,
      6 Vice-Presidents, Speakers of Parliament and Deputy Prime Ministers, 14 Ministers
      and Special Envoys participated in the Summit. 16 international organizations
      attended the meeting.\n\nThe Meeting coincided with the Chairmanship of Kazakhstan
      in the OSCE. Under the auspices of the OSCE on June 7, 2010 a special event:
      “Cooperation in the sphere of economy and security in the 21st century in Eurasia”
      was held. It was attended by the heads of the OSCE Foreign Ministries, the Asian
      partner countries of the OSCE and the CICA Member States. The event was very
      useful in terms of interaction between the OSCE and the CICA.\n\nMember States
      after long and intensive negotiations adopted the Declaration of the Summit,
      in which along with the regional issues (the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq),
      they managed to reflect the current issues of peace, security and stability,
      socio-economic development and culture. The condition on the need to resume
      negotiations on the establishment of the Palestinian state included in the document
      has become a significant achievement of the Summit. Signing of the Convention
      on Privileges and Immunities of the Secretariat, its personnel and representatives
      of the CICA, which had almost completed the institutionalization of the meeting,
      became a great success of the Summit.\n\nThus, __the 3rd CICA Summit__ made
      a significant contribution to further strengthening the international authority
      of Kazakhstan. On September 26, 2011 in New York on the initiative of the Turkish
      presidency on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly the first informal meeting
      of the CICA Foreign Ministers was held. An important aspect of the meeting was
      the signing of the CICA basic documents by the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Kingdom
      of Cambodia. In April 2012 Kazakhstan’s r proposal to extend the Chairmanship
      of Turkey for next two years tenure received the support of most CICA Member
      States. Therefore Turkey which assumed CICA Chairmanship in June 2010 will continue
      to hold the CICA Chairmanship for the period 2012-14. \n\nThe Commemorative
      session and __the Forth CICA Ministerial Meeting__: the CICA Commemorative session
      and Fourth Ministerial Meeting held on September 12, 2012 in Astana was attended
      by delegations of 24 Member States, 8 observer countries and 16 international
      and regional organizations. The Commemorative session dedicated to the 20th
      anniversary of the idea of convening CICA was opened by the President of Kazakhstan
      Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Ministerial Meeting was co-chaired by Ministers of
      Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan and Turkey.\n\nDuring the meeting Foreign Ministers
      of the CICA Member States exchanged views on regional and global issues, and
      discussed ways of strengthening cooperation, peace and security in Asia as well
      as the prospects for further development of CICA.The granting the CICA observer
      status to TurkPA, and an announcement made by China about its readiness to be
      the next CICA Chairman became a significant event of the meeting. In October
      2012 the candidacy of China for the next CICA Chairmanship for the period of
      2014-2016 years was approved by the Member States through the silence procedure.\n\nFollowing
      the results of the CICA Commemorative session and the Fourth Ministerial Meeting
      a Declaration was adopted, in which issues of importance in the field of peace,
      security, stability and socio-economic development of the region, along with
      regional problems were reflected. The Declaration should give new impetus to
      the Conference in promoting peace and security in Asia.\n\nThe President of
      the Republic of Kazakhstan in his speech at the Commemorative session suggested
      transforming CICA into an organization.  On 25 September 2013 in New York on
      the grounds of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly was held an informal
      meeting of the CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs initiated by the Turkish Chairmanship.
      The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Ahmet Davutoğlu, Minister of
      Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, during which representatives of the
      CICA Member States exchanged their views on a range of issues on the international
      agenda, and ways of further development of the Conference.\n\n__The Fourth CICA
      Summit __\n\nThe Fourth Summit of CICA took place on 20-21 May 2014 in Shanghai
      (PRC) during which China assumed chairmanship over CICA from Turkey. 47 states
      and international organizations attended the Meeting. For the first time, the
      UN Secretary General took part in the Summit, Qatar and Bangladesh joined the
      CICA as full members and a number of important documents, namely the Memorandum
      of Understanding between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Secretariat
      of CICA and the new Rules of Procedure which considerably concretized a legal
      framework of its activity, were signed and approved.\n\nFollowing the results
      of the Summit, the political Declaration «Enhancing Dialogue, Trust and Coordination
      for a New Asia of Peace, Stability and Cooperation» was adopted. The purposes
      and the tasks set in the Declaration, give a clear understanding that the Chinese
      chairmanship in CICA will be focusing on strengthening of political and social
      and economic security measures in Asia, ensuring trust and mutual respect through
      establishing its new architecture.  In his Speech at the Summit the President
      of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed an initiative for establishment
      on the basis of CICA - Organization for Security and Development in Asia (OSDA)."

            The idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the world, for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier attempts for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the idea of convocation of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian states defining the political climate on the continent, and the international organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings of the representatives of Foreign Ministries of Asian states were held. Following the results of the given meetings a Special Working Group (SWG) was established. The task of the Group includes preparation of documents for the meeting.

      5 meetings with representatives of state authorities; 5 working meetings of experts of state authorities of Kazakhstan and NATO for an assessment of realization of IPAP; 1 meeting on the Clearing House mechanism (discussion of assistance to Kazakhstan from NATO countries on IPAP realization); 5 joint meetings of high level of North Atlantic Council and Kazakhstan in the NATO+Kazakhstan format took place within IPAP realization during the period from 2006 to 2012. On May 25 2011, Meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for discussion of an assessment of realization of the second cycle IPAP for 2009-2011 was held. The document was positively estimated by Alliance.

      The Ministry of Defense in coordination with the interested state authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan developed the third cycle IPAP for 2012-2013. The project is coordinated previously with the International staff of NATO. New actions in the field of policy, extreme civil planning, a science, and the military sphere are included in it.

      Interaction activization on the mechanism "Clearing House" which can affect high-quality realization of IPAP and plans of bilateral cooperation is initiated. Kazakhstan still shows interest in support of Alliance in definition of the leading country of Alliance (previously the USA expressed readiness to represent itself as the leading state).

      Kazakhstan participates in the "Planning and analysis process" (PAP) program since 2002. PAP is directed on basis creation for definition of structure and an assessment of forces and means, which can be presented for carrying out trainings, doctrines and operations at multinational level in interaction with forces of NATO, including peacekeeping operations. PAP has a biennial cycle. By means of selection and then realization of «The partnership purposes» are undertaken measures to increase the ability of divisions of AF of RK to cooperate with divisions of AF of the countries of NATO.

      The total number of the Purposes of Kazakhstan partnership according to a cycle PAP in 2010 makes 31 (of them 27 from MD, 3 BS from NSC RK, 1 from MES).

      The package of the Purposes of partnership includes the following questions:

      - Defensive planning and AF RK transformation;
      - Preparation and equipment of the peacekeeping contingent on NATO standards;
      - Language preparation;
      - Training of staff officers;
      - Questions of boundary safety;
      - Questions of response to crisis situations.

      In October 2011, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format on discussion of the text of the report of an assessment of realization accepted in 2010 took place. The Ministry of Defense led by the deputy Minister of Defense B. Maykeyev represented Kazakhstan at the meeting.

      During the period from May 23 to May 25 of this year in Astana consultations on discussion of the new Purposes of partnership within NATO program "Process of planning of the analysis" will take place, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for acceptance of the new Purposes of partnership will take place on June 21, 2012.

      In January, 2004 Kazakhstan joined the program «Concept of operative potential» (COP). The program itself presents the mechanism of an assessment of degree of readiness of peacekeeping divisions of the partner countries to interaction with armed forces of the countries of NATO. COP supplements the assessment which is carried out within PAP and promotes increase of military efficiency of estimated forces.

      Now fifteen already were trained on NATO courses on preparation of appraisers of COP on the first level and three officers of AF RK on the second level which allows to carry out self-image of the divisions (the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat") according to requirements of standards of NATO and they can participate on an assessment of divisions of the partner countries declared on the COP program on the basis of inquiry of Alliance.

      In 2006 and 2008 during carrying out the «Steppe Eagle» doctrine by experts of NATO the assessment of operative compatibility of the 2nd company of the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat" and the battalion with forces and means of NATO is carried out. The company is recognized operatively compatible, and a battalion partially operatively as the compatible.

      In 2009-2010 actions within the COP program weren't carried out. Participation of four Kazakhstan officers on a course on preparation of appraisers of the first level of the COP program is planned in May and June, 2012. Thus, in AF of RK number of prepared appraisers will be nineteen. According to COP program, term of certification of "Kazbat" procedures were expired in 2011 .In this regard, the Plan of implementation of the program NATO is approved and coordinated with NATO. For 2012-2013 within which for 2012 "Kazbat'" self-image by national experts, is planned for 2013 "Kazbat" assessment experts by NATO.

      Within preparation and carrying out self-image of "Kazbat" during the «Steppe eagle-2012» doctrine in the spirit of PFP in September of this year on the range "Iliysky" from February 7 to February 10, 2012 is led to the period advisory visit of experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with procedures of carrying out self-image within the COPEK program.

      Also in May visit of three experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with methods of carrying out self-image within the COP program of this year is planned.

      The individual program of partnership and cooperation (IPPC) serves as the annual plan of cooperation between Kazakhstan and NATO, in it the concrete actions which are subject to implementation on 37 (earlier - 33) areas of cooperation which include: assistance in strengthening of democratic control over armed forces, operative compatibility of forces and means, fight against terrorism and extreme civil planning.

      In 2011 147 actions took place within IPPC (507 military personnel serving AF RK, other armies and military formations). 180 actions are planned for 2012 within IPPC (by MD – 160, the MES – 11, MFA-5, the MIA – 2, PS NSC-2). This program also includes the actions which are carried out in the territory of Kazakhstan, such as seminars «Legal aspects of peacekeeping operations», «Process of planning of operations», courses «Military terminology of English in multinational operations», «Staff procedures of NATO» and «Acquaintance with culture and traditions of the people of Central Asia and Afghanistan» with participation of the military personnel of Kazakhstan and representatives of the countries of NATO and partners.

      In 2011 the Kazakhstan military personnel took part in the following doctrines:

      1. «The Viking - 2011» (on April 4-15 – Training center "Zetaleralbe", Austria).
      2. «Amber Hope - 2011» (on June 13-24 – Training center "Pabrada", Lithuania).
      3. «Combined Endevour - 2011» (on September 8-24 – Grafenvyor, Germany).
      4. «Regional cooperation - 2011» (on September 14-27 – Dushanbe, Tajikistan).
      5. «Challenge - 2011» (on October 3-7 – Training center «To Kazlu ruda», Lithuania).

      Courses on preparation for participation in missions of the United Nations from 2003 to 2012 over 30 military personnel of of RK had training preparation within IPPC.
      Participation of the military personnel of AF of RK in doctrines «Longbou's Cooperative», "Lancer Cooperative", "Combined Endevour", «Regional cooperation», "Amber Hope", «Search of the khan» is planned in 2012.

      It should be noted that realization of actions of IPPC in 2012 can be less effective, than in previous years in connection with new financial policy of NATO concerning some countries of partners (Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia).

      According to this policy of NATO will render 100 % the financial help to the partner countries having an internal gross product (gross domestic product) lower than10 000 US dollars per capita and to 80 % for the partner countries which have gross domestic product per capita between 10 000 and 13 550 US dollars. To the partner countries having gross domestic product of over 13 550 US dollars per capita, the financial help of NATO won't be rendered.

      Note: Gross domestic product of the Republic of Kazakhstan made 11 300 US dollars per capita in 2011. In the current year gross domestic product growth in 12 500 US dollars per capita is predicted. The Republic of Kazakhstan is included in the list of the partner countries, to which NATO can render to 80 % of financial support for participation in the planned actions within cooperation with Alliance.

      Due to the late informing by Alliance and the adoption of the budget of the Ministry of Defence of RK for 2012 the planned actions of IPPC-2012 will be realized within funds of MD of RK provided in the budget for 2012.

    Kazakhstan is a participatory member of the United Nations, and fully supportive of the three main pillars of the United Nations - international peace and security, human well-being and humanitarian action, and sustainable development. 

    The Preamble to the Charter spells out that the United Nations was founded "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war". Kazakhstan is uniquely positioned to carry out this charter because of direct experiences in nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, protecting economic and social rights. Kazakhstan shares the imperative to make the Earth habitable for future generations free of conflicts stemming from food, water and energy crises. 

    Kazakhstan is transforming the city of Almaty into a sub-regional multilateral diplomacy and humanitarian hub with focus to enhance United Nations operations in the region and beyond.

  body: |
    Kazakhstan’s work with the OSCE has been broad and consistent to strengthen inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels. In its role as the 2010 OSCE Chairman-in-Office (CiO), the Republic of Kazakhstan followed the “Ministerial Troika” and a  “Quintet” format. Kazakhstan, the first non-European CiO, and paid specific attention to its Chairmanship agenda to the longstanding OSCE priorities, Democracy, Human rights, and Unresolved Conflicts. At the same time, Kazakhstan introduced its own agenda: 

    - __Security__ – Strengthening security in Central Asia is one of the most important priorities of Kazakhstan’s efforts within the OSCE. In addition, Kosovo’s independence can potentially help end unresolved conflicts in Transcaucasia (Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia) and other European regions (Crimea, Moldavia).
    - __Inter-religious tolerance__ – Kazakhstan will enhance international laws that strengthen inter-religious and ethnic tolerance within the OSCE’s zone of responsibility. Foreign Minister Tazhin’s 2008 commitments to cooperate with the OIC and OSCE also illustrate Kazakhstan’s determination in strengthening inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels.
    - __Energy security__ – In support of the European Union energy security agenda, Kazakhstan will strengthen alternative energy. This corresponds with the United States’ policies of energy security, such as the Clean Technology Fund, that focus on alternative energy and the development of clean energy technologies.

    Secretariat: [www.s-cica.org](https://www.s-cica.org)\n\n__Historical background __\n\nThe
    idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President of the Republic of
    Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of the United Nations General
    Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish an efficient and acceptable
    structure for ensuring peace and security in the region was the motivation of
    this initiative. Unlike other regions in the world, for that moment there was
    no such a structure in Asia, and earlier attempts for its creation were not a
    success.  From the very beginning the idea of convocation of the CICA has found
    support of a number of the Asian states defining the political climate on the
    continent, and the international organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE,
    and the LAS). During realization of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings
    of the representatives of Foreign Ministries of Asian states were held. Following
    the results of the given meetings a Special Working Group (SWG) was established.
    The task of the Group includes preparation of documents for the meeting.\n\nPreparatory
    process. In 1993-1994 during the meetings of the representatives of the Asian
    countries’ MFA drafts of the CICA basic documents, i.e. “Rules of Procedure of
    the CICA”, “Declaration of the principles of mutual relations of the CICA Member
    States”, “Structure and institutions of the CICA”, were considered.  In 1996-1997,
    in Almaty, two meetings of Deputy Foreign Ministers of the CICA Member States
    were held.\nIn October 1998, in Almaty the international colloquium on the CICA
    issues, which was attended by 24 experts from 12 States took place. \n\n__The
    First CICA Ministerial Meeting__\n\nOn September 14, 1999 the First Ministerial
    Meeting was held. During this meeting the Declaration, regulating relations between
    the Member States of the meeting – a kind of a prototype of the legal framework
    for establishment of Asian security and cooperation system was signed.\n\nThus,
    for the first time the legal framework of the Asian security, with specific actions,
    measures and mechanisms to ensure stability in the region were laid. The First
    CICA Summit. On June 4, 2002 __the First summit of the Forum__, which brought
    together the heads of Kazakhstan, Russia, China, Pakistan, Turkey, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan,
    Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the Prime Ministers of Azerbaijan and India, the authorized
    officials of Iran, Egypt, Palestine and Israel, the representatives of States
    and observer organizations. During the Summit the Heads of States and Governments
    of the Conference agreed to provide the CICA with the necessary structure and
    institutions to improve the efficiency of its functioning and instructed the Foreign
    Ministers to finalize all aspects of establishment of the CICA Secretariat to
    provide administrative support for regular meetings and political consultations
    and other activities within the framework of the forum.\n\nAccording to the results
    the Almaty Act was signed and the Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting
    Dialogue among Civilizations was adopted. The Second CICA Ministerial Meeting.
    On October 22, 2004 __the Second Ministerial Meeting__, which resulted in the
    adoption of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures, Rules of Procedure
    and Declaration of the Second CICA Ministerial Meeting, was held. Admittance of
    the Kingdom of Thailand as the 17th CICA Member State on the eve of the event
    became another important event.\n\nAccording to the participants, the value of
    the adopted Catalogue of the Confidence Building Measures cannot be overestimated,
    since for the first time in the history of the Asian continent such a large-scale
    document that envisages multilateral cooperation between the countries on a wide
    range of issues of stability and security has appeared. The Declaration reflects
    the consolidated position of the vision and the CICA Member States on the key
    security issues in the world and the region. The heads of delegations stressed
    the need to develop a unified approach to solving the outstanding problems, directions
    of further cooperation in the context of confidence-building measures contained
    in the Catalogue.\n\n__The Second CICA Summit__\n\nOn June 17, 2006 the Second
    Summit of the Forum was held. During the Summit a comprehensive policy document
    – the Declaration of the second Summit was adopted and the basic document on practical
    structuring of the meeting – the Statute of the CICA Secretariat was signed. The
    Declaration reflects the common vision of the Member States on the key issues
    of security and cooperation in Asia and the in world on the whole, the proposals
    of the Member States on development of a universal approach to addressing unresolved
    issues, and the need for practical implementation of the CICA Confidence Building
    Measures which included in the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures 2004,
    and the further development process was declared. On the same day, after signing
    of the relevant statutory document the CICA Secretariat was opened in Almaty.
    It is temporary located in the representative office of the MFA in Almaty.\nThe
    Third CICA Ministerial Meeting: The Third Ministerial Meeting held on August 25,
    2008 in Almaty was attended by delegations of 19 Member States, 7 observer-countries
    s and 6 international and regional organizations. A particular attention was paid
    to the practical implementation of the Cooperative approach. The meeting was productive
    enough: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates were granted
    the full member status, and the State of Qatar joined the CICA as an observer.
    The Declaration “The CICA Progress in implementation of Confidence Building Measures”
    and the final decision of the Ministerial Meeting were adopted.\n\nThe Protocol
    on amendments of the Statute of the CICA Secretariat, providing for the transfer
    of the CICA Secretariat headquarters from Almaty to Astana was signed. President
    of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as the CICA Chairman, welcoming the start of executing
    confidence building measures in the human, economic and environmental dimensions
    as well as in combating new challenges and threats, spoke about the feasibility
    of implementation of practical work on development and strengthening cooperation
    in the military political dimension, which in the long run should become one of
    the most important areas of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures.\nThe
    Third CICA Summit. On June 8, 2010 in Istanbul the Third Summit of Heads of States
    and Governments of the CICA Member States was held. During the Summit for the
    first time in history of the Conference Chairmanship was transferred from the
    Republic of Kazakhstan to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n9 Heads of States and Governments,
    6 Vice-Presidents, Speakers of Parliament and Deputy Prime Ministers, 14 Ministers
    and Special Envoys participated in the Summit. 16 international organizations
    attended the meeting.\n\nThe Meeting coincided with the Chairmanship of Kazakhstan
    in the OSCE. Under the auspices of the OSCE on June 7, 2010 a special event: “Cooperation
    in the sphere of economy and security in the 21st century in Eurasia” was held.
    It was attended by the heads of the OSCE Foreign Ministries, the Asian partner
    countries of the OSCE and the CICA Member States. The event was very useful in
    terms of interaction between the OSCE and the CICA.\n\nMember States after long
    and intensive negotiations adopted the Declaration of the Summit, in which along
    with the regional issues (the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq), they managed to
    reflect the current issues of peace, security and stability, socio-economic development
    and culture. The condition on the need to resume negotiations on the establishment
    of the Palestinian state included in the document has become a significant achievement
    of the Summit. Signing of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the Secretariat,
    its personnel and representatives of the CICA, which had almost completed the
    institutionalization of the meeting, became a great success of the Summit.\n\nThus,
    __the 3rd CICA Summit__ made a significant contribution to further strengthening
    the international authority of Kazakhstan. On September 26, 2011 in New York on
    the initiative of the Turkish presidency on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly
    the first informal meeting of the CICA Foreign Ministers was held. An important
    aspect of the meeting was the signing of the CICA basic documents by the Kingdom
    of Bahrain and the Kingdom of Cambodia. In April 2012 Kazakhstan’s r proposal
    to extend the Chairmanship of Turkey for next two years tenure received the support
    of most CICA Member States. Therefore Turkey which assumed CICA Chairmanship in
    June 2010 will continue to hold the CICA Chairmanship for the period 2012-14. \n\nThe
    Commemorative session and __the Forth CICA Ministerial Meeting__: the CICA Commemorative
    session and Fourth Ministerial Meeting held on September 12, 2012 in Astana was
    attended by delegations of 24 Member States, 8 observer countries and 16 international
    and regional organizations. The Commemorative session dedicated to the 20th anniversary
    of the idea of convening CICA was opened by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan
    Nazarbayev. The Ministerial Meeting was co-chaired by Ministers of Foreign Affairs
    of Kazakhstan and Turkey.\n\nDuring the meeting Foreign Ministers of the CICA
    Member States exchanged views on regional and global issues, and discussed ways
    of strengthening cooperation, peace and security in Asia as well as the prospects
    for further development of CICA.The granting the CICA observer status to TurkPA,
    and an announcement made by China about its readiness to be the next CICA Chairman
    became a significant event of the meeting. In October 2012 the candidacy of China
    for the next CICA Chairmanship for the period of 2014-2016 years was approved
    by the Member States through the silence procedure.\n\nFollowing the results of
    the CICA Commemorative session and the Fourth Ministerial Meeting a Declaration
    was adopted, in which issues of importance in the field of peace, security, stability
    and socio-economic development of the region, along with regional problems were
    reflected. The Declaration should give new impetus to the Conference in promoting
    peace and security in Asia.\n\nThe President of the Republic of Kazakhstan in
    his speech at the Commemorative session suggested transforming CICA into an organization. 
    On 25 September 2013 in New York on the grounds of the 68th Session of the UN
    General Assembly was held an informal meeting of the CICA Ministers of Foreign
    Affairs initiated by the Turkish Chairmanship. The meeting was held under the
    chairmanship of Ahmet Davutoğlu, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of
    Turkey, during which representatives of the CICA Member States exchanged their
    views on a range of issues on the international agenda, and ways of further development
    of the Conference.\n\n__The Fourth CICA Summit __\n\nThe Fourth Summit of CICA
    took place on 20-21 May 2014 in Shanghai (PRC) during which China assumed chairmanship
    over CICA from Turkey. 47 states and international organizations attended the
    Meeting. For the first time, the UN Secretary General took part in the Summit,
    Qatar and Bangladesh joined the CICA as full members and a number of important
    documents, namely the Memorandum of Understanding between the Shanghai Cooperation
    Organization and the Secretariat of CICA and the new Rules of Procedure which
    considerably concretized a legal framework of its activity, were signed and approved.\n\nFollowing
    the results of the Summit, the political Declaration «Enhancing Dialogue, Trust
    and Coordination for a New Asia of Peace, Stability and Cooperation» was adopted.
    The purposes and the tasks set in the Declaration, give a clear understanding
    that the Chinese chairmanship in CICA will be focusing on strengthening of political
    and social and economic security measures in Asia, ensuring trust and mutual respect
    through establishing its new architecture.  In his Speech at the Summit the President
    of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed an initiative for establishment on
    the basis of CICA - Organization for Security and Development in Asia (OSDA)."

          The idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the world, for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier attempts for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the idea of convocation of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian states defining the political climate on the continent, and the international organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings of the representatives of Foreign Ministries of Asian states were held. Following the results of the given meetings a Special Working Group (SWG) was established. The task of the Group includes preparation of documents for the meeting.

    Cooperation of the Republic of Kazakhstan with NATO is based on the Frame document of the Partnership for Peace (PFP) signed in 1994. It includes positions directed for achievement of the following purposes: development of transparency in processes of military planning and formation of the military budget; ensuring democratic control over Armed forces; maintenance of potential and fighting capacity of forces for entering of its contribution into operations under the aegis of the United Nations and/or under the direction of NATO; development of the military relations of cooperation with NATO with a view of joint planning of educational combat training and carrying out doctrines to increase ability to carry out peacekeeping, humanitarian, and other operations; creation of forces which are capable to cooperate with forces of NATO in the long term.

    Realization of tasks, the purposes and ideas of PFP Alliance is carried out within the main programs: Individual plan of action of partnership (IPAP), Process of planning and analysis (PAP), Individual program of partnership (IPP), Concept of operative potential (COP).

    The individual plan of action of partnership was accepted on January 31, 2006 for the purpose of harmonization of all aspects of interaction and their coordination with NATO.

    5 meetings with representatives of state authorities; 5 working meetings of experts of state authorities of Kazakhstan and NATO for an assessment of realization of IPAP; 1 meeting on the Clearing House mechanism (discussion of assistance to Kazakhstan from NATO countries on IPAP realization); 5 joint meetings of high level of North Atlantic Council and Kazakhstan in the NATO+Kazakhstan format took place within IPAP realization during the period from 2006 to 2012. On May 25 2011, Meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for discussion of an assessment of realization of the second cycle IPAP for 2009-2011 was held. The document was positively estimated by Alliance.

    The Ministry of Defense in coordination with the interested state authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan developed the third cycle IPAP for 2012-2013. The project is coordinated previously with the International staff of NATO. New actions in the field of policy, extreme civil planning, a science, and the military sphere are included in it.

    Interaction activization on the mechanism "Clearing House" which can affect high-quality realization of IPAP and plans of bilateral cooperation is initiated. Kazakhstan still shows interest in support of Alliance in definition of the leading country of Alliance (previously the USA expressed readiness to represent itself as the leading state).

    Kazakhstan participates in the "Planning and analysis process" (PAP) program since 2002. PAP is directed on basis creation for definition of structure and an assessment of forces and means, which can be presented for carrying out trainings, doctrines and operations at multinational level in interaction with forces of NATO, including peacekeeping operations. PAP has a biennial cycle. By means of selection and then realization of «The partnership purposes» are undertaken measures to increase the ability of divisions of AF of RK to cooperate with divisions of AF of the countries of NATO.

    The total number of the Purposes of Kazakhstan partnership according to a cycle PAP in 2010 makes 31 (of them 27 from MD, 3 BS from NSC RK, 1 from MES).

    The package of the Purposes of partnership includes the following questions:

    - Defensive planning and AF RK transformation;
    - Preparation and equipment of the peacekeeping contingent on NATO standards;
    - Language preparation;
    - Training of staff officers;
    - Questions of boundary safety;
    - Questions of response to crisis situations.

    In October 2011, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format on discussion of the text of the report of an assessment of realization accepted in 2010 took place. The Ministry of Defense led by the deputy Minister of Defense B. Maykeyev represented Kazakhstan at the meeting.

    During the period from May 23 to May 25 of this year in Astana consultations on discussion of the new Purposes of partnership within NATO program "Process of planning of the analysis" will take place, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for acceptance of the new Purposes of partnership will take place on June 21, 2012.

    In January, 2004 Kazakhstan joined the program «Concept of operative potential» (COP). The program itself presents the mechanism of an assessment of degree of readiness of peacekeeping divisions of the partner countries to interaction with armed forces of the countries of NATO. COP supplements the assessment which is carried out within PAP and promotes increase of military efficiency of estimated forces.

    Now fifteen already were trained on NATO courses on preparation of appraisers of COP on the first level and three officers of AF RK on the second level which allows to carry out self-image of the divisions (the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat") according to requirements of standards of NATO and they can participate on an assessment of divisions of the partner countries declared on the COP program on the basis of inquiry of Alliance.

    In 2006 and 2008 during carrying out the «Steppe Eagle» doctrine by experts of NATO the assessment of operative compatibility of the 2nd company of the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat" and the battalion with forces and means of NATO is carried out. The company is recognized operatively compatible, and a battalion partially operatively as the compatible.

    In 2009-2010 actions within the COP program weren't carried out. Participation of four Kazakhstan officers on a course on preparation of appraisers of the first level of the COP program is planned in May and June, 2012. Thus, in AF of RK number of prepared appraisers will be nineteen. According to COP program, term of certification of "Kazbat" procedures were expired in 2011 .In this regard, the Plan of implementation of the program NATO is approved and coordinated with NATO. For 2012-2013 within which for 2012 "Kazbat'" self-image by national experts, is planned for 2013 "Kazbat" assessment experts by NATO.

    Within preparation and carrying out self-image of "Kazbat" during the «Steppe eagle-2012» doctrine in the spirit of PFP in September of this year on the range "Iliysky" from February 7 to February 10, 2012 is led to the period advisory visit of experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with procedures of carrying out self-image within the COPEK program.

    Also in May visit of three experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with methods of carrying out self-image within the COP program of this year is planned.

    The individual program of partnership and cooperation (IPPC) serves as the annual plan of cooperation between Kazakhstan and NATO, in it the concrete actions which are subject to implementation on 37 (earlier - 33) areas of cooperation which include: assistance in strengthening of democratic control over armed forces, operative compatibility of forces and means, fight against terrorism and extreme civil planning.

    In 2011 147 actions took place within IPPC (507 military personnel serving AF RK, other armies and military formations). 180 actions are planned for 2012 within IPPC (by MD – 160, the MES – 11, MFA-5, the MIA – 2, PS NSC-2). This program also includes the actions which are carried out in the territory of Kazakhstan, such as seminars «Legal aspects of peacekeeping operations», «Process of planning of operations», courses «Military terminology of English in multinational operations», «Staff procedures of NATO» and «Acquaintance with culture and traditions of the people of Central Asia and Afghanistan» with participation of the military personnel of Kazakhstan and representatives of the countries of NATO and partners.

    In 2011 the Kazakhstan military personnel took part in the following doctrines:

    1. «The Viking - 2011» (on April 4-15 – Training center "Zetaleralbe", Austria).
    2. «Amber Hope - 2011» (on June 13-24 – Training center "Pabrada", Lithuania).
    3. «Combined Endevour - 2011» (on September 8-24 – Grafenvyor, Germany).
    4. «Regional cooperation - 2011» (on September 14-27 – Dushanbe, Tajikistan).
    5. «Challenge - 2011» (on October 3-7 – Training center «To Kazlu ruda», Lithuania).

    Courses on preparation for participation in missions of the United Nations from 2003 to 2012 over 30 military personnel of of RK had training preparation within IPPC.
    Participation of the military personnel of AF of RK in doctrines «Longbou's Cooperative», "Lancer Cooperative", "Combined Endevour", «Regional cooperation», "Amber Hope", «Search of the khan» is planned in 2012.

    It should be noted that realization of actions of IPPC in 2012 can be less effective, than in previous years in connection with new financial policy of NATO concerning some countries of partners (Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia).

    According to this policy of NATO will render 100 % the financial help to the partner countries having an internal gross product (gross domestic product) lower than10 000 US dollars per capita and to 80 % for the partner countries which have gross domestic product per capita between 10 000 and 13 550 US dollars. To the partner countries having gross domestic product of over 13 550 US dollars per capita, the financial help of NATO won't be rendered.

    Note: Gross domestic product of the Republic of Kazakhstan made 11 300 US dollars per capita in 2011. In the current year gross domestic product growth in 12 500 US dollars per capita is predicted. The Republic of Kazakhstan is included in the list of the partner countries, to which NATO can render to 80 % of financial support for participation in the planned actions within cooperation with Alliance.

    Due to the late informing by Alliance and the adoption of the budget of the Ministry of Defence of RK for 2012 the planned actions of IPPC-2012 will be realized within funds of MD of RK provided in the budget for 2012.

  title: Human Rights
  body: "Kazakhstan’s [work on human rights](https://astanatimes.com/2014/12/kazakhstan-works-improve-protection-human-rights-ombudsman-says/)
    in Kazakhstan has been recognized on an international level, in particular by
    the UN Human Rights Council and the Committee against Torture. Kazakhstan has
    also attracted foreign partners for joint human right’s projects, including the
    OSCE, UN Children’s Fund, Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
    and Penal Reform International. In 2012, the United Nations elected [Kazakhstan
    to the Human Rights Council](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/271693-kazakhstans-appointment-to-unhcr#disqus_thread) for
    a three year term. \n\nKazakhstan has consistently recognized the importance of
    human rights to the success of the country. The first article of [the constitution](http://www.constitution.kz/english/)
    states that the highest values of are “an individual, his life, rights and freedoms.”
    There is a recognition that while the post-Soviet situation upon independence
    was not ideal, Kazakhstan has made earnest efforts towards improving Kazakhstan's
    human rights.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted this year’s first meeting
    of the Dialogue on Human Dimension Consultative and Advisory Body (CAB), chaired
    by Minister Beibut Atamkulov. In his speech, Atamkulov noted CAB’s unique position
    as a dialogue platform for discussing important social and political processes
    occurring in Kazakhstan. The organisation, established in 2013, provides for an
    open state policy and commitment to dialogue with civil society. Since its formation,
    the meaningfulness and relevance of the discussions have never decreased, but
    only increased depending on the topics concerned, and are highlighted by their
    constructive attitude. “Today, the Republic of Kazakhstan is a party to all key
    international instruments in the field of the promotion and protection of human
    rights. This undoubtedly testifies to the firm commitment of our state to the
    values and principles of the protection of human rights, as well as the consistent
    strengthening of our national human rights system,” he said. In turn, Kazakhstan’s
    human rights activists positively assessed CAB’s work, expressing full support
    for further activities and suggesting ways to improve the dialogue format. Participants
    from Kazakh NGOs were positive about CAB’s role and the importance of implementing
    the human rights aspects under discussion in a practical way. The meeting was
    attended by members of the Mazhilis (lower house of Parliament) and representatives
    of state agencies and the nation’s civil sector. Representatives of UN and [OSCE](https://kazakhembus.com/foreign-policy/international-organizations/organization-for-security-and-co-operation-in-europe-osce)
    missions attended as observers. \n\nThere are many positive areas of progress
    that underscore these initiatives. In tandem to serving on the UNHRC, Kazakhstan's
    UN mission held the Vice Chairmanship of the UN Human Rights Office and recognized
    the responsibility that came with this leadership role.\n\nKazakhstan adopted
    new versions of the Criminal Code, Criminal Executive Code and new Criminal Procedure
    Code which will serve to expand equality, curb corruption and strengthen the judiciary
    in the country. \n\nBilateral meetings of the __Strategic Partnership Dialogue__
    between the United States and Kazakhstan [regularly reinforce](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/12/234936.htm)
    both country'a commitment to human rights, democracy, media and independent organizations
    in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2015 then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Erlan Idrissov attended
    the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Conference on Disarmament
    where he reminded all delegates that Kazakhstan submits periodic reports to the
    UN showing compliance with all major international policies. Idrissov also held
    bilateral meetings with Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner
    for Human Rights and Michael Möller, acting director-general of the UN office
    in Geneva. Tleuberdi notes that Kazakhstan has regularly welcomed international
    special rapporteurs examining key human issues like Right to Peaceful Assembly."

    title: Human Rights Action Plan
    body: |-
      In 2009, President Nazarbayev announced the national Human Rights Action Plan, a program to improve human rights in Kazakhstan in conjunction with the country’s holding of the OSCE chairmanship in 2010. The Plan was undertaken between 2009 and 2012 in order to present recommendations for improving human rights in the country across a variety of sectors. Labor, free speech, religious freedom, minorities, and women are but a few of the numerous categories reviewed by the National Plan. It revealed the presence of gaps in how human rights are proscribed for and applied in the country, citing a need to improve coordination and organization among governmental and nongovernmental entities in order to protect human rights.

      After the conclusion of the National Plan in 2012, a follow-up meeting between officials from Kazakhstan and the European Union discussed Kazakhstan’s intention of creating a new plan for 2014 and afterwards. European officials cited areas for improvement but also welcomed this move by Kazakhstan to continue its cooperation and focus on human rights at the local and international levels.

      Since 2002, Kazakhstan has had a Commissioner for Human Rights in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Ombudsman) for human rights. The Commissioner and his associated organization, the National Center for Human Rights, are empowered to investigate human rights issues in the government per the decree of President Nazarbayev. His office has been taking steps to bring itself into compliance with the Paris Principles adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in 1991, as well as implement recommendations for UN member states as approved by the Kazakhstan government in 2011.

      The Kazakhstan Parliament is also reviewing a draft law on preventing torture and other cruel or degrading punishment that also elevates the status of the Ombudsman and his authority. This would allow for the Ombudsman to prepare annual reports on the country’s national human rights mechanism and publicize annual reports on its progress.

          the country’s holding of the OSCE chairmanship in 2010. The Plan was undertaken
          between 2009 and 2012 in order to present recommendations for improving
          human rights in the country across a variety of sectors. Labor, free speech,
          religious freedom, minorities, and women are but a few of the numerous categories
          reviewed by the National Plan. It revealed the presence of gaps in how human
          rights are proscribed for and applied in the country, citing a need to improve
          coordination and organization among governmental and nongovernmental entities
          in order to protect human rights.

        value: After the conclusion of the National Plan in 2012, a follow-up meeting
          between officials from Kazakhstan and the European Union discussed Kazakhstan’s
          intention of creating a new plan for 2014 and afterwards. European officials
          cited areas for improvement but also welcomed this move by Kazakhstan to
          continue its cooperation and focus on human rights at the local and international
          levels.

  title: Human Rights Ombudsman
  body: |-
    Since 2002, Kazakhstan has had a Commissioner for Human Rights in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Ombudsman) for human rights. The Commissioner and his associated organization, the National Center for Human Rights, are empowered to investigate human rights issues in the government per the decree of President Nazarbayev. His office has been taking steps to bring itself into compliance with the Paris Principles adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in 1991, as well as implement recommendations for UN member states as approved by the Kazakhstan government in 2011.

    The Kazakhstan Parliament is also reviewing a draft law on preventing torture and other cruel or degrading punishment that also elevates the status of the Ombudsman and his authority. This would allow for the Ombudsman to prepare annual reports on the country’s national human rights mechanism and publicize annual reports on its progress.

  title: Climate Change
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan is actively contributing to the global response to climate change and takes seriously the consequences of the world’s collective inaction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Kazakhstan has made domestic commitments to reduce GHG emissions by 15 percent by 2020, and 25 percent by 2050, which will equal emission levels of 1992. As stated by President Nazarbayev in hisKazakhstan 2050 Strategy, Kazakhstan seeks to derive 50 percent of domestic energy power from renewable, green technology sources. 

    Although Kazakhstan possesses world-class conventional energy resources, it has developed ambitious plans to nurture a green economy in Kazakhstan, which will increase living standards, and technological development while minimizing the environmental impact. The Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development participants supported the Green Bridge Partnership Program initiated by Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council coincides with the Astana Expo 2017, themed "Future Energy", where Kazakhstan will showcase technology, equipment and best practices that will be key to facilitating a global shift towards a [green economy](http://kzgreenenergy.com/). 

    Kazakhstan is also keenly mindful of the serious risks climate change and rising sea levels present for island nations and other geographically disadvantaged states.

  title: Counter-Terrorism
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan takes seriously its international obligations in the fight against terrorism. As part of its commitments to implementing United Nations resolutions, Kazakhstan works closely with the  __Counter-Terrorism Committees of the UN Security Council__, and has joined the multilateral effort to combat transnational crime, such as illegal trafficking of drugs, arms, and human beings.

    President Nazarbayev has prioritized countering terrorism and violent extremism as one of the most serious threats to peace and security. President Nazarbayev has proposed several directions for UN member states to concentrate joint efforts.

    *"We need to establish a United Nations-led counter terrorism coalition and develop a common mechanism for locating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of extremism and terrorism. Secondly, we need to establish a United Nations-led counter terrorism coalition and develop a common mechanism for locating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of extremism and terrorism. Third, we must establish a universal set of regulations and rules related to the fight against terrorists and extremists, which would be applicable to all states."* - __President Nazarbayev__

    title: Climate Change
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan is actively contributing to the global response to climate change and takes seriously the consequences of the world’s collective inaction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Kazakhstan has made domestic commitments to reduce GHG emissions by 15 percent by 2020, and 25 percent by 2050, which will equal emission levels of 1992. As stated by President Nazarbayev in hisKazakhstan 2050 Strategy, Kazakhstan seeks to derive 50 percent of domestic energy power from renewable, green technology sources. 

      Although Kazakhstan possesses world-class conventional energy resources, it has developed ambitious plans to nurture a green economy in Kazakhstan, which will increase living standards, and technological development while minimizing the environmental impact. The Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development participants supported the Green Bridge Partnership Program initiated by Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council coincides with the Astana Expo 2017, themed "Future Energy", where Kazakhstan will showcase technology, equipment and best practices that will be key to facilitating a global shift towards a [green economy](http://kzgreenenergy.com/). 

      Kazakhstan is also keenly mindful of the serious risks climate change and rising sea levels present for island nations and other geographically disadvantaged states.

    title: Counter-Terrorism
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan takes seriously its international obligations in the fight against terrorism. As part of its commitments to implementing United Nations resolutions, Kazakhstan works closely with the  __Counter-Terrorism Committees of the UN Security Council__, and has joined the multilateral effort to combat transnational crime, such as illegal trafficking of drugs, arms, and human beings.

      President Nazarbayev has prioritized countering terrorism and violent extremism as one of the most serious threats to peace and security. President Nazarbayev has proposed several directions for UN member states to concentrate joint efforts.

      *"We need to establish a United Nations-led counter terrorism coalition and develop a common mechanism for locating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of extremism and terrorism. Secondly, we need to establish a United Nations-led counter terrorism coalition and develop a common mechanism for locating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of extremism and terrorism. Third, we must establish a universal set of regulations and rules related to the fight against terrorists and extremists, which would be applicable to all states."* - __President Nazarbayev__

      Kazakhstan has contributed US$300,000 to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund to support Member States in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.

    title: Human Rights
    body: "Kazakhstan’s [work on human rights](https://astanatimes.com/2014/12/kazakhstan-works-improve-protection-human-rights-ombudsman-says/)
      in Kazakhstan has been recognized on an international level, in particular by
      the UN Human Rights Council and the Committee against Torture. Kazakhstan has
      also attracted foreign partners for joint human right’s projects, including
      the OSCE, UN Children’s Fund, Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
      and Penal Reform International. In 2012, the United Nations elected [Kazakhstan
      to the Human Rights Council](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/271693-kazakhstans-appointment-to-unhcr#disqus_thread) for
      a three year term. \n\nKazakhstan has consistently recognized the importance
      of human rights to the success of the country. The first article of [the constitution](http://www.constitution.kz/english/)
      states that the highest values of are “an individual, his life, rights and freedoms.”
      There is a recognition that while the post-Soviet situation upon independence
      was not ideal, Kazakhstan has made earnest efforts towards improving Kazakhstan's
      human rights.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted this year’s first meeting
      of the Dialogue on Human Dimension Consultative and Advisory Body (CAB), chaired
      by Minister Beibut Atamkulov. In his speech, Atamkulov noted CAB’s unique position
      as a dialogue platform for discussing important social and political processes
      occurring in Kazakhstan. The organisation, established in 2013, provides for
      an open state policy and commitment to dialogue with civil society. Since its
      formation, the meaningfulness and relevance of the discussions have never decreased,
      but only increased depending on the topics concerned, and are highlighted by
      their constructive attitude. “Today, the Republic of Kazakhstan is a party to
      all key international instruments in the field of the promotion and protection
      of human rights. This undoubtedly testifies to the firm commitment of our state
      to the values and principles of the protection of human rights, as well as the
      consistent strengthening of our national human rights system,” he said. In turn,
      Kazakhstan’s human rights activists positively assessed CAB’s work, expressing
      full support for further activities and suggesting ways to improve the dialogue
      format. Participants from Kazakh NGOs were positive about CAB’s role and the
      importance of implementing the human rights aspects under discussion in a practical
      way. The meeting was attended by members of the Mazhilis (lower house of Parliament)
      and representatives of state agencies and the nation’s civil sector. Representatives
      of UN and [OSCE](https://kazakhembus.com/foreign-policy/international-organizations/organization-for-security-and-co-operation-in-europe-osce)
      missions attended as observers. \n\nThere are many positive areas of progress
      that underscore these initiatives. In tandem to serving on the UNHRC, Kazakhstan's
      UN mission held the Vice Chairmanship of the UN Human Rights Office and recognized
      the responsibility that came with this leadership role.\n\nKazakhstan adopted
      new versions of the Criminal Code, Criminal Executive Code and new Criminal
      Procedure Code which will serve to expand equality, curb corruption and strengthen
      the judiciary in the country. \n\nBilateral meetings of the __Strategic Partnership
      Dialogue__ between the United States and Kazakhstan [regularly reinforce](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/12/234936.htm)
      both country'a commitment to human rights, democracy, media and independent
      organizations in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2015 then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Erlan
      Idrissov attended the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN
      Conference on Disarmament where he reminded all delegates that Kazakhstan submits
      periodic reports to the UN showing compliance with all major international policies.
      Idrissov also held bilateral meetings with Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al-Hussein, the
      UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Michael Möller, acting director-general
      of the UN office in Geneva. Tleuberdi notes that Kazakhstan has regularly welcomed
      international special rapporteurs examining key human issues like Right to Peaceful
      Assembly."

      title: Human Rights Action Plan
      body: |-
        In 2009, President Nazarbayev announced the national Human Rights Action Plan, a program to improve human rights in Kazakhstan in conjunction with the country’s holding of the OSCE chairmanship in 2010. The Plan was undertaken between 2009 and 2012 in order to present recommendations for improving human rights in the country across a variety of sectors. Labor, free speech, religious freedom, minorities, and women are but a few of the numerous categories reviewed by the National Plan. It revealed the presence of gaps in how human rights are proscribed for and applied in the country, citing a need to improve coordination and organization among governmental and nongovernmental entities in order to protect human rights.

        After the conclusion of the National Plan in 2012, a follow-up meeting between officials from Kazakhstan and the European Union discussed Kazakhstan’s intention of creating a new plan for 2014 and afterwards. European officials cited areas for improvement but also welcomed this move by Kazakhstan to continue its cooperation and focus on human rights at the local and international levels.

      title: Human Rights Ombudsman
      body: |-
        Since 2002, Kazakhstan has had a Commissioner for Human Rights in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Ombudsman) for human rights. The Commissioner and his associated organization, the National Center for Human Rights, are empowered to investigate human rights issues in the government per the decree of President Nazarbayev. His office has been taking steps to bring itself into compliance with the Paris Principles adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in 1991, as well as implement recommendations for UN member states as approved by the Kazakhstan government in 2011.

        The Kazakhstan Parliament is also reviewing a draft law on preventing torture and other cruel or degrading punishment that also elevates the status of the Ombudsman and his authority. This would allow for the Ombudsman to prepare annual reports on the country’s national human rights mechanism and publicize annual reports on its progress.

        Kazakhstan is a participatory member of the United Nations, and fully supportive of the three main pillars of the United Nations - international peace and security, human well-being and humanitarian action, and sustainable development. 

        The Preamble to the Charter spells out that the United Nations was founded "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war". Kazakhstan is uniquely positioned to carry out this charter because of direct experiences in nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, protecting economic and social rights. Kazakhstan shares the imperative to make the Earth habitable for future generations free of conflicts stemming from food, water and energy crises. 

        Kazakhstan is transforming the city of Almaty into a sub-regional multilateral diplomacy and humanitarian hub with focus to enhance United Nations operations in the region and beyond.

      body: |
        Kazakhstan’s work with the OSCE has been broad and consistent to strengthen inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels. In its role as the 2010 OSCE Chairman-in-Office (CiO), the Republic of Kazakhstan followed the “Ministerial Troika” and a  “Quintet” format. Kazakhstan, the first non-European CiO, and paid specific attention to its Chairmanship agenda to the longstanding OSCE priorities, Democracy, Human rights, and Unresolved Conflicts. At the same time, Kazakhstan introduced its own agenda: 

        - __Security__ – Strengthening security in Central Asia is one of the most important priorities of Kazakhstan’s efforts within the OSCE. In addition, Kosovo’s independence can potentially help end unresolved conflicts in Transcaucasia (Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia) and other European regions (Crimea, Moldavia).
        - __Inter-religious tolerance__ – Kazakhstan will enhance international laws that strengthen inter-religious and ethnic tolerance within the OSCE’s zone of responsibility. Foreign Minister Tazhin’s 2008 commitments to cooperate with the OIC and OSCE also illustrate Kazakhstan’s determination in strengthening inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels.
        - __Energy security__ – In support of the European Union energy security agenda, Kazakhstan will strengthen alternative energy. This corresponds with the United States’ policies of energy security, such as the Clean Technology Fund, that focus on alternative energy and the development of clean energy technologies.

            value: Kazakhstan’s work with the OSCE has been broad and consistent to
              strengthen inter-religious and interethnic dialogue at all levels. In
              its role as the 2010 OSCE Chairman-in-Office (CiO), the Republic of
              Kazakhstan followed the “Ministerial Troika” and a  “Quintet” format.

              to its Chairmanship agenda to the longstanding OSCE priorities, Democracy,
              Human rights, and Unresolved Conflicts. At the same time, Kazakhstan

        background __\n\nThe idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President
        of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of
        the United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish
        an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the
        region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the
        world, for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier
        attempts for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the
        idea of convocation of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian
        states defining the political climate on the continent, and the international
        organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization
        of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings of the representatives of Foreign
        Ministries of Asian states were held. Following the results of the given meetings
        a Special Working Group (SWG) was established. The task of the Group includes
        preparation of documents for the meeting.\n\nPreparatory process. In 1993-1994
        during the meetings of the representatives of the Asian countries’ MFA drafts
        of the CICA basic documents, i.e. “Rules of Procedure of the CICA”, “Declaration
        of the principles of mutual relations of the CICA Member States”, “Structure
        and institutions of the CICA”, were considered.  In 1996-1997, in Almaty,
        two meetings of Deputy Foreign Ministers of the CICA Member States were held.\nIn
        October 1998, in Almaty the international colloquium on the CICA issues, which
        was attended by 24 experts from 12 States took place. \n\n__The First CICA
        Ministerial Meeting__\n\nOn September 14, 1999 the First Ministerial Meeting
        was held. During this meeting the Declaration, regulating relations between
        the Member States of the meeting – a kind of a prototype of the legal framework
        for establishment of Asian security and cooperation system was signed.\n\nThus,
        for the first time the legal framework of the Asian security, with specific
        actions, measures and mechanisms to ensure stability in the region were laid.
        The First CICA Summit. On June 4, 2002 __the First summit of the Forum__,
        which brought together the heads of Kazakhstan, Russia, China, Pakistan, Turkey,
        Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the Prime Ministers of Azerbaijan
        and India, the authorized officials of Iran, Egypt, Palestine and Israel,
        the representatives of States and observer organizations. During the Summit
        the Heads of States and Governments of the Conference agreed to provide the
        CICA with the necessary structure and institutions to improve the efficiency
        of its functioning and instructed the Foreign Ministers to finalize all aspects
        of establishment of the CICA Secretariat to provide administrative support
        for regular meetings and political consultations and other activities within
        the framework of the forum.\n\nAccording to the results the Almaty Act was
        signed and the Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting Dialogue
        among Civilizations was adopted. The Second CICA Ministerial Meeting. On October
        22, 2004 __the Second Ministerial Meeting__, which resulted in the adoption
        of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures, Rules of Procedure and Declaration
        of the Second CICA Ministerial Meeting, was held. Admittance of the Kingdom
        of Thailand as the 17th CICA Member State on the eve of the event became another
        important event.\n\nAccording to the participants, the value of the adopted
        Catalogue of the Confidence Building Measures cannot be overestimated, since
        for the first time in the history of the Asian continent such a large-scale
        document that envisages multilateral cooperation between the countries on
        a wide range of issues of stability and security has appeared. The Declaration
        reflects the consolidated position of the vision and the CICA Member States
        on the key security issues in the world and the region. The heads of delegations
        stressed the need to develop a unified approach to solving the outstanding
        problems, directions of further cooperation in the context of confidence-building
        measures contained in the Catalogue.\n\n__The Second CICA Summit__\n\nOn June
        17, 2006 the Second Summit of the Forum was held. During the Summit a comprehensive
        policy document – the Declaration of the second Summit was adopted and the
        basic document on practical structuring of the meeting – the Statute of the
        CICA Secretariat was signed. The Declaration reflects the common vision of
        the Member States on the key issues of security and cooperation in Asia and
        the in world on the whole, the proposals of the Member States on development
        of a universal approach to addressing unresolved issues, and the need for
        practical implementation of the CICA Confidence Building Measures which included
        in the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures 2004, and the further development
        process was declared. On the same day, after signing of the relevant statutory
        document the CICA Secretariat was opened in Almaty. It is temporary located
        in the representative office of the MFA in Almaty.\nThe Third CICA Ministerial
        Meeting: The Third Ministerial Meeting held on August 25, 2008 in Almaty was
        attended by delegations of 19 Member States, 7 observer-countries s and 6
        international and regional organizations. A particular attention was paid
        to the practical implementation of the Cooperative approach. The meeting was
        productive enough: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates
        were granted the full member status, and the State of Qatar joined the CICA
        as an observer. The Declaration “The CICA Progress in implementation of Confidence
        Building Measures” and the final decision of the Ministerial Meeting were
        adopted.\n\nThe Protocol on amendments of the Statute of the CICA Secretariat,
        providing for the transfer of the CICA Secretariat headquarters from Almaty
        to Astana was signed. President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as the CICA
        Chairman, welcoming the start of executing confidence building measures in
        the human, economic and environmental dimensions as well as in combating new
        challenges and threats, spoke about the feasibility of implementation of practical
        work on development and strengthening cooperation in the military political
        dimension, which in the long run should become one of the most important areas
        of the Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures.\nThe Third CICA Summit.
        On June 8, 2010 in Istanbul the Third Summit of Heads of States and Governments
        of the CICA Member States was held. During the Summit for the first time in
        history of the Conference Chairmanship was transferred from the Republic of
        Kazakhstan to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n9 Heads of States and Governments,
        6 Vice-Presidents, Speakers of Parliament and Deputy Prime Ministers, 14 Ministers
        and Special Envoys participated in the Summit. 16 international organizations
        attended the meeting.\n\nThe Meeting coincided with the Chairmanship of Kazakhstan
        in the OSCE. Under the auspices of the OSCE on June 7, 2010 a special event:
        “Cooperation in the sphere of economy and security in the 21st century in
        Eurasia” was held. It was attended by the heads of the OSCE Foreign Ministries,
        the Asian partner countries of the OSCE and the CICA Member States. The event
        was very useful in terms of interaction between the OSCE and the CICA.\n\nMember
        States after long and intensive negotiations adopted the Declaration of the
        Summit, in which along with the regional issues (the Middle East, Afghanistan,
        Iraq), they managed to reflect the current issues of peace, security and stability,
        socio-economic development and culture. The condition on the need to resume
        negotiations on the establishment of the Palestinian state included in the
        document has become a significant achievement of the Summit. Signing of the
        Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the Secretariat, its personnel
        and representatives of the CICA, which had almost completed the institutionalization
        of the meeting, became a great success of the Summit.\n\nThus, __the 3rd CICA
        Summit__ made a significant contribution to further strengthening the international
        authority of Kazakhstan. On September 26, 2011 in New York on the initiative
        of the Turkish presidency on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly the
        first informal meeting of the CICA Foreign Ministers was held. An important
        aspect of the meeting was the signing of the CICA basic documents by the Kingdom
        of Bahrain and the Kingdom of Cambodia. In April 2012 Kazakhstan’s r proposal
        to extend the Chairmanship of Turkey for next two years tenure received the
        support of most CICA Member States. Therefore Turkey which assumed CICA Chairmanship
        in June 2010 will continue to hold the CICA Chairmanship for the period 2012-14. \n\nThe
        Commemorative session and __the Forth CICA Ministerial Meeting__: the CICA
        Commemorative session and Fourth Ministerial Meeting held on September 12,
        2012 in Astana was attended by delegations of 24 Member States, 8 observer
        countries and 16 international and regional organizations. The Commemorative
        session dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the idea of convening CICA was
        opened by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Ministerial
        Meeting was co-chaired by Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan and Turkey.\n\nDuring
        the meeting Foreign Ministers of the CICA Member States exchanged views on
        regional and global issues, and discussed ways of strengthening cooperation,
        peace and security in Asia as well as the prospects for further development
        of CICA.The granting the CICA observer status to TurkPA, and an announcement
        made by China about its readiness to be the next CICA Chairman became a significant
        event of the meeting. In October 2012 the candidacy of China for the next
        CICA Chairmanship for the period of 2014-2016 years was approved by the Member
        States through the silence procedure.\n\nFollowing the results of the CICA
        Commemorative session and the Fourth Ministerial Meeting a Declaration was
        adopted, in which issues of importance in the field of peace, security, stability
        and socio-economic development of the region, along with regional problems
        were reflected. The Declaration should give new impetus to the Conference
        in promoting peace and security in Asia.\n\nThe President of the Republic
        of Kazakhstan in his speech at the Commemorative session suggested transforming
        CICA into an organization.  On 25 September 2013 in New York on the grounds
        of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly was held an informal meeting
        of the CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs initiated by the Turkish Chairmanship.
        The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Ahmet Davutoğlu, Minister of
        Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, during which representatives of
        the CICA Member States exchanged their views on a range of issues on the international
        agenda, and ways of further development of the Conference.\n\n__The Fourth
        CICA Summit __\n\nThe Fourth Summit of CICA took place on 20-21 May 2014 in
        Shanghai (PRC) during which China assumed chairmanship over CICA from Turkey.
        47 states and international organizations attended the Meeting. For the first
        time, the UN Secretary General took part in the Summit, Qatar and Bangladesh
        joined the CICA as full members and a number of important documents, namely
        the Memorandum of Understanding between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
        and the Secretariat of CICA and the new Rules of Procedure which considerably
        concretized a legal framework of its activity, were signed and approved.\n\nFollowing
        the results of the Summit, the political Declaration «Enhancing Dialogue,
        Trust and Coordination for a New Asia of Peace, Stability and Cooperation»
        was adopted. The purposes and the tasks set in the Declaration, give a clear
        understanding that the Chinese chairmanship in CICA will be focusing on strengthening
        of political and social and economic security measures in Asia, ensuring trust
        and mutual respect through establishing its new architecture.  In his Speech
        at the Summit the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed an
        initiative for establishment on the basis of CICA - Organization for Security
        and Development in Asia (OSDA)."

              The idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, at the 47th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 5, 1992. Aspiration to establish an efficient and acceptable structure for ensuring peace and security in the region was the motivation of this initiative. Unlike other regions in the world, for that moment there was no such a structure in Asia, and earlier attempts for its creation were not a success.  From the very beginning the idea of convocation of the CICA has found support of a number of the Asian states defining the political climate on the continent, and the international organizations (the United Nations, the OSCE, and the LAS). During realization of the initiative in 1993-1994 three meetings of the representatives of Foreign Ministries of Asian states were held. Following the results of the given meetings a Special Working Group (SWG) was established. The task of the Group includes preparation of documents for the meeting.

It includes positions directed for achievement of the following purposes: development of transparency in processes of military planning and formation of the military budget; ensuring democratic control over Armed forces; maintenance of potential and fighting capacity of forces for entering of its contribution into operations under the aegis of the United Nations and/or under the direction of NATO; development of the military relations of cooperation with NATO with a view of joint planning of educational combat training and carrying out doctrines to increase ability to carry out peacekeeping, humanitarian, and other operations; creation of forces which are capable to cooperate with forces of NATO in the long term.

        Realization of tasks, the purposes and ideas of PFP Alliance is carried out within the main programs: Individual plan of action of partnership (IPAP), Process of planning and analysis (PAP), Individual program of partnership (IPP), Concept of operative potential (COP).

        The individual plan of action of partnership was accepted on January 31, 2006 for the purpose of harmonization of all aspects of interaction and their coordination with NATO.

        5 meetings with representatives of state authorities; 5 working meetings of experts of state authorities of Kazakhstan and NATO for an assessment of realization of IPAP; 1 meeting on the Clearing House mechanism (discussion of assistance to Kazakhstan from NATO countries on IPAP realization); 5 joint meetings of high level of North Atlantic Council and Kazakhstan in the NATO+Kazakhstan format took place within IPAP realization during the period from 2006 to 2012. On May 25 2011, Meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for discussion of an assessment of realization of the second cycle IPAP for 2009-2011 was held. The document was positively estimated by Alliance.

        The Ministry of Defense in coordination with the interested state authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan developed the third cycle IPAP for 2012-2013. The project is coordinated previously with the International staff of NATO. New actions in the field of policy, extreme civil planning, a science, and the military sphere are included in it.

        Interaction activization on the mechanism "Clearing House" which can affect high-quality realization of IPAP and plans of bilateral cooperation is initiated. Kazakhstan still shows interest in support of Alliance in definition of the leading country of Alliance (previously the USA expressed readiness to represent itself as the leading state).

        Kazakhstan participates in the "Planning and analysis process" (PAP) program since 2002. PAP is directed on basis creation for definition of structure and an assessment of forces and means, which can be presented for carrying out trainings, doctrines and operations at multinational level in interaction with forces of NATO, including peacekeeping operations. PAP has a biennial cycle. By means of selection and then realization of «The partnership purposes» are undertaken measures to increase the ability of divisions of AF of RK to cooperate with divisions of AF of the countries of NATO.

        The total number of the Purposes of Kazakhstan partnership according to a cycle PAP in 2010 makes 31 (of them 27 from MD, 3 BS from NSC RK, 1 from MES).

        The package of the Purposes of partnership includes the following questions:

        - Defensive planning and AF RK transformation;
        - Preparation and equipment of the peacekeeping contingent on NATO standards;
        - Language preparation;
        - Training of staff officers;
        - Questions of boundary safety;
        - Questions of response to crisis situations.

        In October 2011, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format on discussion of the text of the report of an assessment of realization accepted in 2010 took place. The Ministry of Defense led by the deputy Minister of Defense B. Maykeyev represented Kazakhstan at the meeting.

        During the period from May 23 to May 25 of this year in Astana consultations on discussion of the new Purposes of partnership within NATO program "Process of planning of the analysis" will take place, meeting of Committee on policy and partnership in the NATO+Kazakhstan format for acceptance of the new Purposes of partnership will take place on June 21, 2012.

        In January, 2004 Kazakhstan joined the program «Concept of operative potential» (COP). The program itself presents the mechanism of an assessment of degree of readiness of peacekeeping divisions of the partner countries to interaction with armed forces of the countries of NATO. COP supplements the assessment which is carried out within PAP and promotes increase of military efficiency of estimated forces.

        Now fifteen already were trained on NATO courses on preparation of appraisers of COP on the first level and three officers of AF RK on the second level which allows to carry out self-image of the divisions (the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat") according to requirements of standards of NATO and they can participate on an assessment of divisions of the partner countries declared on the COP program on the basis of inquiry of Alliance.

        In 2006 and 2008 during carrying out the «Steppe Eagle» doctrine by experts of NATO the assessment of operative compatibility of the 2nd company of the peacekeeping battalion "Kazbat" and the battalion with forces and means of NATO is carried out. The company is recognized operatively compatible, and a battalion partially operatively as the compatible.

        In 2009-2010 actions within the COP program weren't carried out. Participation of four Kazakhstan officers on a course on preparation of appraisers of the first level of the COP program is planned in May and June, 2012. Thus, in AF of RK number of prepared appraisers will be nineteen. According to COP program, term of certification of "Kazbat" procedures were expired in 2011 .In this regard, the Plan of implementation of the program NATO is approved and coordinated with NATO. For 2012-2013 within which for 2012 "Kazbat'" self-image by national experts, is planned for 2013 "Kazbat" assessment experts by NATO.

        Within preparation and carrying out self-image of "Kazbat" during the «Steppe eagle-2012» doctrine in the spirit of PFP in September of this year on the range "Iliysky" from February 7 to February 10, 2012 is led to the period advisory visit of experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with procedures of carrying out self-image within the COPEK program.

        Also in May visit of three experts of NATO to RK for acquaintance with methods of carrying out self-image within the COP program of this year is planned.

        The individual program of partnership and cooperation (IPPC) serves as the annual plan of cooperation between Kazakhstan and NATO, in it the concrete actions which are subject to implementation on 37 (earlier - 33) areas of cooperation which include: assistance in strengthening of democratic control over armed forces, operative compatibility of forces and means, fight against terrorism and extreme civil planning.

        In 2011 147 actions took place within IPPC (507 military personnel serving AF RK, other armies and military formations). 180 actions are planned for 2012 within IPPC (by MD – 160, the MES – 11, MFA-5, the MIA – 2, PS NSC-2). This program also includes the actions which are carried out in the territory of Kazakhstan, such as seminars «Legal aspects of peacekeeping operations», «Process of planning of operations», courses «Military terminology of English in multinational operations», «Staff procedures of NATO» and «Acquaintance with culture and traditions of the people of Central Asia and Afghanistan» with participation of the military personnel of Kazakhstan and representatives of the countries of NATO and partners.

        In 2011 the Kazakhstan military personnel took part in the following doctrines:

        1. «The Viking - 2011» (on April 4-15 – Training center "Zetaleralbe", Austria).
        2. «Amber Hope - 2011» (on June 13-24 – Training center "Pabrada", Lithuania).
        3. «Combined Endevour - 2011» (on September 8-24 – Grafenvyor, Germany).
        4. «Regional cooperation - 2011» (on September 14-27 – Dushanbe, Tajikistan).
        5. «Challenge - 2011» (on October 3-7 – Training center «To Kazlu ruda», Lithuania).

        Courses on preparation for participation in missions of the United Nations from 2003 to 2012 over 30 military personnel of of RK had training preparation within IPPC.
        Participation of the military personnel of AF of RK in doctrines «Longbou's Cooperative», "Lancer Cooperative", "Combined Endevour", «Regional cooperation», "Amber Hope", «Search of the khan» is planned in 2012.

        It should be noted that realization of actions of IPPC in 2012 can be less effective, than in previous years in connection with new financial policy of NATO concerning some countries of partners (Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia).

        According to this policy of NATO will render 100 % the financial help to the partner countries having an internal gross product (gross domestic product) lower than10 000 US dollars per capita and to 80 % for the partner countries which have gross domestic product per capita between 10 000 and 13 550 US dollars. To the partner countries having gross domestic product of over 13 550 US dollars per capita, the financial help of NATO won't be rendered.

        Note: Gross domestic product of the Republic of Kazakhstan made 11 300 US dollars per capita in 2011. In the current year gross domestic product growth in 12 500 US dollars per capita is predicted. The Republic of Kazakhstan is included in the list of the partner countries, to which NATO can render to 80 % of financial support for participation in the planned actions within cooperation with Alliance.

        Due to the late informing by Alliance and the adoption of the budget of the Ministry of Defence of RK for 2012 the planned actions of IPPC-2012 will be realized within funds of MD of RK provided in the budget for 2012.

    title: Nuclear Nonproliferation & Security
    body: "All facets of modern Kazakhstan and national identity have been shaped
      by its [history](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/kazakhstan-nuclear-disarmament/)with
      nuclear weapons. The lives of all Kazakhs have in some way been singed by nuclear
      testing. The former Soviet Union treated Kazakh soil as a nuclear testing ground
      and conducted as many as 460 nuclear tests. \n\nKazakhstan inherited upon independence
      more than 1400 nuclear weapons, and President Nazarbayev quickly moved to decommission
      each warhead and tactical weapon. Today Kazakhstan stands as an clear example
      of how a nation can obtain economic prosperity and national security without
      nuclear weapons, rather than with them. \n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan’s contribution
      to the nuclear disarmament program demonstrates its commitment to the objectives
      of global security, establishing Kazakhstan as a critical member of the world
      community.  \n\n<div class=\"usa-alert usa-alert-info\">\n<div class=\"usa-alert-body\">\n<h3
      class=\"usa-alert-heading\">Nuclear Threat Initiative; Washington, D.C</h3>\n<p
      class=\"usa-alert-text\">Kazakhstan’s experience in disarming itself of nuclear
      weapons following the fall of the Soviet Union could serve as a model for other
      countries, most notably Iran. During a symposium held here on Capitol Hill,
      Kazakh and U.S. officials, former officials and other experts detailed Kazakhstan’s
      transformation during the 1990s from a newly independent country possessing
      one of the world’s largest nuclear arsenals to one that renounced nuclear weapons
      and has since worked to dismantle its Soviet-era WMD architecture with U.S.
      assistance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n    \nOn the 29th of December 1991, the leaders
      of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine signed the Almaty Declaration, in
      which they agreed on the control mechanisms over the operation of the nuclear
      arsenal of the former USSR and affirmed their international obligations concerning
      the strategic arms reduction.\n\nOn the 23rd of May 1992, in Lisbon the representatives
      of Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and USA signed a five party Protocol
      to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. At the same time Belarus, Ukraine and
      Kazakhstan, as the states possessing nuclear weapons, committed themselves to
      the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thus Kazakhstan has made a historical decision
      to renounce its nuclear heritage which was an important step strengthening the
      statehood of our country as an integral part of existing world civilization.\n\nIn
      accordance with the Lisbon Protocol, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine, as successor
      states to the USSR in terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, have agreed
      to participate, along with Russia and USA, in the work of the joint Commission
      on observance and inspection. They have also agreed to conclude agreements on
      the limits and restrictions specified by the Treaty. Kazakhstan ratified the
      Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, which is an integral part of the Treaty, on
      the 2nd of July 1992. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty came into force in
      1994 and paved the way to disarmament and the elimination of more than 9,000
      nuclear warheads under strict supervision.\n\nKazakhstan was the first among
      the participants of the Lisbon Protocol to implement the provisions concerning
      removal of nuclear warheads. On the 21st of April 1996 the process of removal
      of 1416 nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan territory was completed. On the 30th
      of May 1995 the last nuclear test warhead, which was located in a gallery on
      the Semipalatinsk test site, was destroyed. Finally Kazakhstan had got rid of
      its nuclear inheritance forever.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, Kazakhstan was the
      site of the world’s fourth largest nuclear arsenal of more than 1000 deadly
      ICBMs which posed a menacing, if not dangerous, threat to international peace,
      depending on the leadership and direction of that country when it became independent
      in 1991. Fortunately, that leader was President Nursultan Nazarbayev who acted
      decisively to order the dismantling and removal of the country’s entire nuclear
      weapons system. \n\nIn 1994, Kazakhstan transferred more than a half-ton of
      weapons-grade uranium to the U.S. In 1995, Kazakhstan removed its last nuclear
      warhead and, with U.S. assistance, completed the sealing of 181 nuclear test
      tunnels in May 2000. Kazakhstan has signed the START Treaty (1992), the Nuclear
      Non-Proliferation Treaty (1993), the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive
      Test Ban Treaty (2001).\n\nOn March, 21, 2009 the Treaty on Nuclear Weapon Free
      Zone in Central Asia, signed on September, 8, 2006 in Semei, Kazakhstan, went
      into force. Kazakhstan welcomes the Treaty’s becoming effective and believes
      that it will contribute to global non-proliferation process and promote regional
      and international security. The new denuclearized zone in Central Asia has a
      number of unique features. First, one of the zone’s state namely, Kazakhstan,
      in the past possessed the forth largest nuclear arsenal. Secondly, for the first
      time the denuclearized zone is created in Northern hemisphere. Thirdly, this
      Treaty becomes the first multilateral agreement in security area which brings
      together all five Central Asian countries. And finally, for the first time the
      denuclearized zone has been created in the region which borders upon two nuclear
      states. The Protocol on negative security assurances is an integral part of
      the Treaty. Under the Protocol, the nuclear weapon states pledge not to use
      or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any states member to the Treaty.\n\nOn
      June 18, 2009 over 25,000 locals, Kazakh dignitaries and world media gathered
      in Semey city to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's decision to
      stop nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site. The meeting was held in Semey
      where President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed an appeal to the international
      community to back up the peaceful mission of Kazakhstan. In his speech, President
      Nazarbayev emphasized that refusal to conduct nuclear testing has become possible
      due to courage and enthusiasm of millions of Kazakhs that put an end to the
      crimes against lives and health of the whole people of Kazakhstan. Besides he
      noted that “starting from the first days of the country’s independence, Kazakhstan
      did not leave its citizens alone with their problems. The work on social rehabilitation
      of the population and the territories suffered the harm of the nuclear tests
      is being constantly carried out. For these purposes the state utilized nearly
      KZT 34 billion (approximately $215 million)”.\n\nIn December 2009, the UN General
      Assembly unanimously accepted a resolution put forward by Kazakhstan proclaiming
      August 29, the day when in 1991 President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree
      on the closure of Semipalatinsk Test Site, as the ‘International Day against
      Nuclear Tests’. Recognizing the negative impact of nuclear testing on human
      life and the environment, as well as the importance of ending nuclear tests
      as one of the key means of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world, the Resolution
      sets out to commemorate a significant date in Kazakhstan’s – and, indeed, -
      the world’s history.\n\nThe international community has fully appreciated Kazakhstan’s
      contribution to this nuclear disarmament program. Paying a visit to Kazakhstan
      in April 2010 U.N. Secretary General Ban Kim-moon said “I highly commend the
      extraordinary leadership of president Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who courageously
      closed this nuclear test site and initiated the nuclear weapon-free zone in
      Central Asia. That’s a big milestone”.\n\nDuring the Nuclear Security Summit
      in Washington, D.C. in April, 2010 Obama praised President Nazarbayev \"as really
      one of the model leaders in the world on nonproliferation and nuclear-safety
      issues\". U.S. President B. Obama and other leaders also took positive view
      on President Nazarbayev's proposition to establish an International Nuclear
      Fuel Bank on the Kazakh territory. President Nazarbayev highly appraised the
      antinuclear initiatives and achievements of the U.S. President in ensuring international
      security, namely, convocation of the Global Nuclear Security Summit, signing
      the New START Treaty with Russia, adoption of the new US nuclear posture review
      which had become a great step towards establishment of the nuclear-free world.\n\n "

    title: Regional Stability & Security
    body: "Kazakhstan’s leadership in regional security cooperation has contributed
      to stability, peace and economic prosperity of the neighboring countries. The
      country has supported stabilization activities in Afghanistan and fought the
      common regional security threats, including nuclear proliferation, terrorism,
      trafficking in persons, narcotics, and organized crime as well as the newly
      emerging ones - climate change, food security, and water security. Kazakhstan
      has worked with the US since its independence in 1991 to advance the country’s
      capabilities to tackle these threats and ensure regional stability.\n\nKazakhstan
      has assumed a critical role as a regional leadership role in supporting the
      stabilization of Afghanistan. The country granted the overflight rights to coalition
      forces during operation Enduring Freedom and has since allowed for continued
      air and land transit for NATO ad US troops and equipment supplies to and from
      Afghanistan, effectively integrating into the Northern Distribution Network
      (NDN). In addition, Kazakhstan has played an important role in economic recovery
      of Afghanistan and efforts to integrate the country into the region within the
      US Department of State’s New Silk Road Initiative. \n\nThe government has established
      a $50 million scholarship program to educate one thousand Afghan students at
      Kazakhstan’s universities. It co-chaired the Istanbul Process, opened a trade
      office in Kabul, contributed to the sustainment of Afghan National Security
      forces, built infrastructure, and established KazAID – an aid agency focusing
      on Afghanistan and Central Asia. The infrastructure projects supported by the
      government include financing the construction of schools, hospitals, bridges,
      water supplies and the Kunduz-Talukan road. KazAID aims to render $2 million
      worth of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan in 2014."

      title: Afghanistan
      body: "Kazakhstan has a pro-active actor in the world scene regards the situation
        in Afghanistan as a priority on its foreign policy agenda and exerts serious
        efforts to facilitate reconstruction in this country which plays a crucial
        role in the long-term security and stability in Central Asia. That’s why rehabilitation
        of this country is a major foreign policy priority of Kazakhstan who strongly
        favours a comprehensive and continued international effort to bring lasting
        peace and economic development to Afghanistan.\n\nOver the last years Kazakhstan
        made significant contribution to stabilization of Afghanistan. In 2001 Kazakhstan
        provided no-cost over-flight rights for “Enduring Freedom” operation. Similar
        arrangements have been developed and adopted between Kazakhstan and Germany
        at the end of 2007. In 2002 Kazakhstan offered its emergency landing air fields
        for US military and cargo planes. Being one of the key parts of so-called
        Northern Distribution Network through which about 35% of all US cargo arrives
        to Afghanistan since 2009 Kazakhstan made its rail and motor roads available
        for transit of non-lethal shipments needed for NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nKazakhstan
        has successfully allocate $50 million to educate 1000 Afghan people since
        2010. Education of Afghan people was carried out in the universities of Kazakhstan
        in such specialties as healthcare, agriculture, police, border control, engineering,
        teachers and educators. \n\nThis Cooperation in Education Agreement is successful
        and the foundation of a [new joint-program](https://astanatimes.com/2019/10/eu-undp-and-kazakhstan-launch-education-programme-to-train-afghan-women/)
        launched by Kazakhstan with the EU Commission and UNDP to graduate 50 Afghan
        women with advanced degrees from regional universities. \n\nIn 2018 Kazakhstana
        [hosted](https://astanatimes.com/2018/09/conference-on-empowerment-of-afghan-women-secures-e2-million-education-pledge-calls-for-enhanced-application-of-international-norms/)
        a Conference on empowerment of Afghan women and secured a €2 million education

        & Education of Afghan Women</h3>\n    <p class=\"usa-alert-text\">“Women empowerment
        is not only a matter of human rights and social justice. It’s about development,
        human growth and fulfilling the country’s potential. The European Union will
        continue to be the strongest supporter of women.”<br> \n    EU High Representative
        for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini; Regional Conference
        on Women’s Empowerment in Afghanistan<br>\nSeptember 7, 2018, Nur-Sultan \n
        \   </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nIn accordance with Bonn Process, 2006 London
        Conference, 2008 Paris Donor Conference on Afghanistan during 2006-2009 Kazakhstan
        has undertaken a number of steps like humanitarian aid to Afghanistan ($ 1
        mln.), scholarships for 100 Afghani students to study in the national universities
        (geology, engineering, etc.), training programs for Afghanistan’s police and
        internal security service, signing with Government of Afghanistan the Protocol
        of Intentions to build railway road Termez (Uzbekistan) – Kabul (Afghanistan)
        with further access to the transport infrastructure of India, creation of
        the Kazakh-Afghan Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n\nKazakhstan
        is the only Central Asian country which has the Assistance Program on Reconstruction
        of Afghanistan. In 2007-2008 Governmental Action Plan on Assistance to Afghanistan
        has been successfully accomplished. Total financial funding in sum of $ 3
        mln. has been provided to restore agricultural seed supply of Afghanistan
        ($0.5 mln.), to build a school in Samangan province ($0.28 mln.), a hospital
        in Bamiyan province ($0.57 mln.) and a road ($ 1.65 mln.).\n\nUnder the next
        Governmental Action Plan on Assistance to Afghanistan for 2009-2011 Kazakhstan
        allocated $5 million for projects related to water supply, infrastructure
        development and delivery of grains and other commodities.   \n\nThe Action
        Plan allocated considerable resources for providing humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.
        The aid included the delivery of commodities and materials as well as construction
        of four bridges crossing the river through the town of Aibak and strengthening
        the river banks.   \n\nKazakhstan also stands for more regional involvement
        to the solution of Afghan problem and, in this regard, fully supported the
        US strategy on Afghanistan which contained comprehensive vision on how to
        operate in «AfPak» zone. \n\nStabilization of Afghanistan was and continues
        to be one of the most important issues to discuss during high-level exchanges
        between Kazakhstan and USA."

  title: Economy
  body: "Kazakhstan has quickly become a regional economic powerhouse thanks to its
    macroeconomic stability, improved business environment, and vast energy and mineral
    resources.\n\nThe Kazakhstan of today has made great strides considering the our
    country was built from the wreckage of the former Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has
    attracted more than __$250 billion in foreign direct investment since 1991__ –
    the most of any former Soviet country. Kazakhstan’s economy grew by 10% annually
    in the ten years before the 2008 global financial crisis. At the time, Kazakhstan’s
    GDP was equal in size to the GDPs of all Central Asian and Southern Caucasus economies
    combined. \n\nKazakhstan has weathered the global financial crisis well through
    a dexterous response, combining fiscal relaxation with monetary stabilization.
    During the global economic crisis, Kazakhstan’s economic growth slowed down to
    1.2% in 2009, while the annual growth rate subsequently increased to 5% and 6%
    in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The country’s economic diversification and industrialization
    programs are expected to help economy maintain a healthy growth rate over the
    medium term.  Foreign trade turnover increased by 25 percent to __$69.5 billion__
    in 2017. \n\n__Kazakhstan's modernization and economic development priorities
    include__:\n- modernization and a shift towards non-oil sources for economic growth;\n-
    industrial diversification, innovation, investment in human capital;\n- international
    trade integration for job creation;\n- Strengthening governance, the business-enabling
    environment, and private-sector enterprise.\n\nApart from oil and gas, infrastructure
    is another powerful driver of our economic development. Kazakhstan is the largest
    landlocked country, but strategically located at the crossroads of Europe and
    Asia. Kazakhstan has worked to be an integral and efficient part of regional transport
    and logistics systems. Since independence, transportation infrastructural projects
    became powerful drivers of economic development. The Kazakhstan Government has
    allocated about $ 9 billion for national transportation infrastructural strategies
    and programs, and that number will likely increase as the New Silk Road and One
    Belt One Road programs progress.\n\nOur goal is to serve as a land bridge between
    Europe and China. In a way, we are a gateway not only to Central Asia, but also
    to Eurasia. We have excellent relationship with EU and have made well known our
    goal to join achieve OECD membership. Kazakhstan signed an Enhanced Partnership
    Agreement with the EU, the only such agreement with a Central Asian nation. Kazakhstan
    participants to the the OECD Competition Committee, Committee for Industry, Innovation
    and Entrepreneurship, Committee on Statistics and Statistical Policy and Investment
    Committee. \n\nThe United States is the second largest investor in Kazakhstan’s
    economy. Many American companies seek to invest in Kazakhstan for its  unique
    investment climate and good access to the Eurasian market. One of the pillars
    of our economic partnership with the United States is a history of success in
    areas of trade and investment, particularly in oil and gas and heavy manufacturing
    of locomotives. \n\nKazakhstan’s “brand perception” is at its highest in several
    years with increased awareness from established and non-established investors,
    especially in the areas of energy, industrial and automotive divisions, high-tech,
    telecommunication infrastructure and business. Established foreign investors in
    Kazakhstan view the country as the most attractive post-Soviet investment destination
    and highly value Kazakhstan's macroeconomic and sociopolitical stability, as well
    as its competitive corporate tax rate.\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan has made
    significant efforts to remove bureaucratic obstacles to investment and the creation
    of an attractive business environment, which has been consistently reflected in
    the last three editions of the World Bank’s Doing Business report as well as other
    internationally recognized indices.  \n\n{% include perf_example.html\n  text='MercedesBenz
    launched the world premiere of the URBANETIC electric vehicle.  URBANETIC features
    an advanced powertrain platform that may be a new class of  transportation and
    \ logistics solution. Mercedes’ YouTube introduces URBANETIC as “a visionary mobility
    concept for urban areas”.  Notable for Kazakhstan, the premiere video included
    Astana's cityscape. Astana is an appropriate backdrop for the URBANETIC launch
    for the smart city infrastructure Astana is built, and “future”-concepts that
    Astana embodies.'\n%}\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_2BXldHY-o\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
    picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\nKazakhstan's efforts to strengthen
    the state's fiscal balance, reduce the national debt, and aid the recovery of
    the banking sector following the 2007-08 crisis, prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade
    Kazakhstan's sovereign rating to BBB + with a stable outlook in November 2012.
    Similarly, Moody’s Investors Service revised Kazakhstan’s sovereign credit outlook
    to positive from stable in August 2013.\n\nKazakhstan’s business-friendly laws
    support the growth of foreign investment and stronger economic growth. In 2018,
    __FDI amounted to almost $25 billion__, the equivalent of 10% of GDP. FDI has
    introduced new forms of technology and jobs for domestic firms and subcontractors
    that partner with foreign entities, while transferring skills and know-how to
    the indigenous labor force. While the majority of FDI to date has been channeled
    into the oil, gas and mining sectors, and their associated services, the Government
    emphasizes promoting FDI into other industries in order to the country’s dependence
    on extractive industries, as part of its 2050 strategy.\n\nUnder Kazakhstan's
    steady development, the Kazakh people have experienced steady wage growth. Kazakhstan's
    per capita Gross National Income is above other Central Asian and Eurasian countries."

  title: Priority Sectors
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan is deeply committed to diversifying its economy outside of the lucrative energy and mining sectors. There are numerous other sectors where the country shows high growth potential in the coming years and the government is actively supporting investment in these areas through legal and financial means.

    In June 2014, Kazakhstan announced that foreign investors in non-energy sectors would receive a 10-year tax break on corporate and land taxes. Special Economic Zones that focus on priority growth sectors allow for additional investment benefits, such as exemptions for corporate income taxes and rent-free land for 10 years.

    The identified priority sectors are part of the government’s State Program of Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development (SPAIID), a cornerstone of its economic goals.

    title: Energy
    body: |-
      - Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top 20 oil producers, with the ninth-most proven reserves in the world and about a 2% share in global production. 
      - Kazakhstan holds 30 billion barrels (four billion tons) of proven recoverable oil reserves and potential reserves of 100-110 billion barrels.
      - New projects being developed have led industry experts to estimate that by 2015, Kazakhstan will be one of the top five oil exporters in the world, with three million barrels per day.
      - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).
      - By 2011, Kazakhstan’s extractive industry made up about a quarter of the country’s GDP, while crude oil alone accounted for 60% of all exports. The oil sector currently accounts for more than half of all tax revenues.
      - Kazakhstan has made major investments to develop a Green Energy sector. President Nazarbayev has pledged that 50 percent of Kazakhstan's energy consumption come from green sources by the year 2050.
      - The country has 3% of the world’s raw materials and a natural resource base of over $300,000 per capita, which is among the highest in the world and is twice the level of Russia and higher than Australia.
      - It has 4% of the global iron reserves, 8% of the world’s zinc reserves and 4% of the world’s chrome reserves.

      Today new large-scale projects in the sphere of high processing of our natural resources are taking place.

      1) The Government has began the construction of the first module of the Balkhash Thermal Station with the power of 1320 MW and worth 2.3 billion USD, in order to solve the problem of energy shortages and energy dependency of the southern regions.
      2) One of the largest energy project in Kazakhstan is also the construction of the Moinak hydro-electric power station. The capacity of Bestyubinsk water reservoir is enough to store up to 300 million cubic meters of water. Two powerful hydro-turbines produce 300 megawatt of electric power.

      title: Oil & Gas
      body: |
        Kazakhstan’s oil and gas complex remains the powerhouse of our economy.

        - The share of the oil and gas sector within the country’s GDP has been growing at a steady rate, increasing from 3.7% in 1997 to 14.7% in 2006 and up to 25.8% in 2011.
        - Kazakhstan diversified its export markets and secured its position, thereby has reduced its dependence on any particular export direction.
        - In the early 1990s, President Nazarbayev had the foresight to create a fund, based on the Norwegian model, which preserved oil and gas revenues for our children and our grandchildren. This so-called “fund for future generations” has now accumulated over $47 billion and is the cornerstone to managing and preserving the country’s oil wealth.
        - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).

        The oil and gas sector represents a major dimension of the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral partnership. After all, in 1993, Chevron became the first major Western oil company to invest in Kazakhstan with the creation of TengizChevroil. Over the past twenty two years, Western energy firms and their advanced technologies have been essential to fueling the growth of Kazakhstan’s oil industry and uncovering some of the most challenging offshore, deep-sea energy deposits in the world.

            value: The oil and gas sector represents a major dimension of the U.S.-Kazakhstan
              bilateral partnership. After all, in 1993, Chevron became the first
              major Western oil company to invest in Kazakhstan with the creation
              of TengizChevroil. Over the past twenty two years, Western energy firms
              and their advanced technologies have been essential to fueling the growth
              of Kazakhstan’s oil industry and uncovering some of the most challenging
              offshore, deep-sea energy deposits in the world.

      body: |
        - Kazakhstan has significant potential in renewable energy sector with its low population density and access to renewable energy sources such as wind, sun, and water.
        - The UNDP estimates that the potential for wind energy alone exceeds Kazakhstan’s current energy consumption by ten-fold.
        - The government aims for the share of renewable energy in domestic electricity generation to rise to 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
        - By 2020 the country should have 13 wind, 14 hydropower and four solar power plants, as well as a nuclear power plant.
        - In 2013 Kazakhstan adopted legislation establishing feed-in tariffs for renewables, which will be in place for 15 year, and provides capital subsidies.

        Together with Islamic Development Bank, the country has established a renewable energy fund of $50 million that hopes to attract strategic investment flows and expertize into renewable energy sector, particularly wind, solar, biomass and small hydro.

        In 2013 the government has launched a pilot version of the national carbon-trading scheme. In 2017, Kazakhstan will for the first time host the World Expo exhibition, dedicated to ‘Future Energy’. 

        __[Green Bridge](http://gbpp.org/en/)__
        Kazakhstan’s Green Bridge Initiative [was adopted](http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=1006&menu=1348&nr=2237) by the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development and aims to strengthen national and international governance, develop informational infrastructure, boost outreach and education, encourage green business and related technologies, introduce effective financial and economic mechanisms, and the creation of unified standards for the green economy.

        The Green Bridge targets conservation in five core sectors:

        - mountainous and wetland ecosystems,
        - sustainable energy (availability and efficiency),
        - food security,
        - urban infrastructure and transport,
        - adaptation to climate change and natural disasters.

        __[Expo 2017](https://expo2017astana.com/en/)__

        From June 10 to September 10, 2017 Kazakhstan’s Astana will be the first CIS city to host the World's Fair exhibition. For the first time EXPO will be dedicated to ‘Future of Energy’, facilitating discussion of the international community on innovation in energy and presentation of best practices in energy applications by experts. EXPO will make a significant contribution to the development and use of alternative energy sources globally, creating more environmentally-friendly economies as well as provide an impetus for Kazakhstan’s own transition to a green economy.

      After almost three years of stagnation in the Kazakhstani credit market, loans to the economy by banks had been renewed. The volume of  loans by banks increased by 15.7 percent and made up KZT 8.8 billion ($58.7 million). The volume of loans in the national currency increased by 29.6 percent and in foreign currency reduced by 3.4 percent.

      In order to increase the populations’ trust in banks and to activate the depositary market, the amount of individuals’ deposits coverage had been increased to KZT 5 million ($33,367).

      The National Bank carried out an additional capitalization of the Kazakhstan deposits insurance fund. As a result of these measures, deposits were raised by 19.7 percent in 2009 (9.7 percent without the devaluation effect), by 11.6 percent in 2010 and by 14.3 percent in 2011, to KZT 8.4 trillion ($56.0 billion).

    title: Mining & Smelting
    body: |-
      Mining represents 27% of the country’s GDP and has immense growth potential.

      70 elements have been explored and 60 extracted so far in Kazakhstan. Its mineral and resources base consists of 5,004 fields with a net worth of $46 trillion.

      Currently, the Industrialization Map of Kazakhstan includes 61 mining and smelting industry projects, with an investment of KZT 1.5 trillion ($10.0 billion). In 2011, 11 projects brought the economy a new worth of KZT 52.7 billion ($351.9 million) and 2,700 new jobs. The most significant of these include oil and gas, uranium, zinc, lead (2nd largest reserves in the world), manganese (3rd largest reserves in the world), and copper (5th largest reserves in the world).

      In terms of production, Kazakhstan is in third place of production of titanium, seventh for zinc, eighth for lead, thirteenth for iron ore, fifteenth for copper and thirty fifth for steel. Other mining operations in the country focus on tungsten, bohrium, silver, chromites, copper, fluorides, molybdenum, and gold. About 80 percent of all mining industry products are exported to more than 30 countries, making 20 percent of the total exports and 30 percent of the country’s revenues.

      To support the development of the mining and smelting industries, in 2010 the government approved the Mining-Smelting Industry Development Program for 2010-14. The program is aimed at rational and optimal use and development of mineral resources for the purposes of production of high-technology and science-intensive finished products. The government expects 107 percent growth of gross value added for metallurgy products.

    title: Agribusiness
    body: |-
      ![Agriculture](//images.ctfassets.net/3u75lz35gn9w/2LmnpyuGvmw2G4Gcwc2GeS/33808749f78b3bc53b7d11f7004975c8/Agriculture.jpg)

      Agribusiness and agriculture combine to comprise a critical sector of the Kazakh economy. The rich soil and climate (similar to the U.S. state of North and South Dakota and Nebraska) provide ideal conditions for growing wheat, barley, rice, corn, millet and buckwheat and raising livestock - especially American [Black Angus](https://www.inquisitr.com/382988/transplanted-north-dakota-cattle-doing-well-in-kazakhstan/). Kazakhstan’s major crops are wheat, barley, cotton, and rice.  Kazakhstan is one of the top 10 grain exporters in the world, exporting to over 70 countries.

      For a country with a long nomadic history, it is not surprising that stockbreeding is the traditional and dominant agricultural sector. No less than three quarters of all agricultural land is used for grazing. Sheep breeding is predominant, while cattle breeding and the raising of pigs, horses and camels are also well developed. Animal husbandry typically accounts for about 45-50 percent of the production value in agriculture in Kazakhstan. Primary meat products include beef, veal, chicken, horse, lamb, pork and rabbit.

      The livestock sector is gradually growing. Meat production increased by 8% to 270,550 tonnes in 2018. Kazakhstan produced 535,501tonnes of milk in 2018, which is a 10% increase compared to 2017.

      The Government provides subsidized loans to agricultural enterprises, subsidies for machinery upgrades and construction, state-funding of organizations developing veterinary and phytosanitary sectors, the provision of subsidies for industrial energy costs. It also waved import duties on farm equipment, raw materials and spare parts, and exemption from corporate income and property taxes. According to the 2018 data, international investors have tripled their activity in agricultural business since 2004.

      title: Land Code Reforms
      body: |-
        Kazakhstan recently made reforms to the existing agriculture land codes to encourage foreign direct investment into the priority sector. The new codes will drive investment into Kazakhstan's rural communities, create modernized agricultural jobs, increase transparency by making public the details of land auctions, and add up to 15 years to the land leases available to foreign investors. Kazakhstan's land code reforms better position Kazakhstan to support its commitment to [Food Security](http://kazakhstanun.com/kazakhstan-un-security-council/) and providing stability to global food markets.

    title: Transportation & Logistics
    body: |-
      Being sandwiched between Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan boasts of a great transit potential, as there is no alternatives for Asian states to link to Russia and Europe. Relatively diverse landscape and availability of natural stone reserves allow unrestricted development of railways and automobile routes.

      Four international transport corridors cross the territory of Kazakhstan and are formed on the basis of transport infrastructure existing in the country. They are:

      - __Northern Corridor of Trans-Asian Railway Main (TARM)__: Western Europe – China, Korean Peninsula and Japan via Russian and Kazakhstan (section Dostyk – Aktogai - Sayak – Mointy – Astana – Petropavlovsk (Presnogorkovskaya)).
      - __Southern Corridor of TARM__: South-Eastern Europe – China and South-Eastern Asia via Turkey, Iran, Central Asian states and Kazakhstan (section Dostyk – Aktogai – Almaty- Shu – Arys – Saryagash).
      - __TRACECA__: Eastern Europe – Central Asia via the Black Sea, Caucasus and the Caspian Sea (section Dostyk – Almaty – Aktau).
      - __North-South__: Northern Europe – Gulf States via Russia and Iran, with Kazakhstan’s participation in the following sections: sea port Aktau – Ural regions of Russia and Aktau

      Kazakhstan Government has elaborated and approved Strategy of Transport Sector Development of up to 2015; the amount of investments required for construction of respective infrastructure within the 10 years will make up USD 26 billion.

      Ultimate goal of the Transport Strategy is to ensure progressive development of transport and communications complex in line with economic strategy of the state. The Strategy covers 2006-2015 and is supposed to be implemented in two stages: 1st stage – 2006-2011, 2nd stage – 2011-2015.

      The Strategy implementation is expected to ensure bringing of the national transport system to a higher level, and forming of an optimum transport network. Financing of the infrastructure on the self-sufficiency principles will allow accommodating resources for its further sustainable development and maintenance at a high technical level.

      On Feburary 1, 2016 a new container train service on the China-Iran route via Kazakhstan was launched. The 9,000-kilometre route runs from the city of Yiwu (Zhejiang Province, East China) through the Alashankou-Dostyk border crossing to Kazakhstan’s new Zhezkazgan-Beineu and Uzen-Bolashak lines and via Turkmenistan’s railway network to Tehran. With only a 10-day transit time, the 40-foot containers on the train can travel much faster overland than by sea, which takes from 25 – 30 days. In establishing the new service, the railway companies of China, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran collaborated to identify logistics solutions needed to speed up the delivery of cargo from East China to Persian Gulf markets.

      Kazakhstan is well-positioned to develop a chemical production sector through its wealth of raw materials. Petroleum-related downstream products, such as phosphates and sulfuric acid, are part of this focus. The pharmaceutical sector will take advantage of the high level of scientific and educational development in the country’s southeast area.

      With vast oil reserves and raw chemical material deposits, Kazakhstan has huge growth potential in the petrochemical industry. In 2004, the government adopted the “__Program for development of the petrochemical industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2008-2013__,” pursuant to which it has started constructing the National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark in Atyrau that will convert the resources from Tengiz and Kashagan oil fields to high-value petrochemical products for export and domestic consumption.

    body: |-
      Technological innovation is at the forefront of efforts to diversify Kazakhstan’s economy. The government aims to become a major technological hub in Central Asia, focusing on ICT.

      Kazakhstan’s strategic location between China and Europe allows for it to play a critical linking role between these economic giants, as well as acting as the communications hub for fast-growing Central Asia.

      __The Park of Information Technologies in Alatau__, a special economic zone, has been established to facilitate transfer of technology and foster innovation.

      The local demand for high-quality telecommunication infrastructure and services, particularly Internet access and data transfer services, is increasing with rapid economic and social progress. There is a demonstrated market demand for a more agile technological infrastructure, included upgraded telecommunications networks in rural and urban areas and enhancing broadband Internet access.

      While there are international firms working on these projects, Kazakhstan is interested in attracting the high-tech expertise of U.S. companies.

    title: Manufacturing
    body: |-
      The production of machine equipment is vital to Kazakhstan’s development and relates to several other core economic goals, such as the growth of the energy and mining sectors as well as infrastructure.

      Manufacturing that serves the country’s booming construction sector is also a high-growth opportunity and the gross value-added amount for Kazakhstan’s industrial engineering sector in all of 2008 was equaled in the first half of 2013, a sign of the machinery sector’s booming growth.

      Machinery constitutes an important share of the Kazakhstan’s non-agricultural imports from the US. In 2013, machinery represented $333 million of the non-agriculture imports from the US (which totaled $882 million the same year).

      Kazakhstan’s pharmaceutical market, on the other hand, is the most accessible, transparent and, from a legislative point of view, progressive in Central Asia. Currently, some 70% of domestically consumed medicine is imported, while 30% are internally manufactured. 

      The government adopted a resolution on “__The State Program for the Development of Pharmaceutical Industry for 2010-2014__,” with the objective of increasing domestic production of pharmaceuticals from 30 to 50% by the end of 2014. Under the program, foreign manufactures are eligible to obtain equal treatment with domestic ones if they decide to produce domestically.

  title: New Silk Road
  body: |-
    The "[New Silk Road](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/building-new-silk-road)" is an infrastructure project expected to significantly accelerate and reduce the cost of goods delivery from China to Europe through Central Asia and the Caucasus. For this project, Beijing established a $40 billion Silk Road fund, as well as the $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

    Kazakhstan, the leading economic powerhouse in Central Asia, is a key player in the New Silk Road project. On April 9, 2013, Kazakhstan’s Ambassador to the United States, Kairat Umarov, said in his speech in Washington DC: “The New Silk Road vision complement's Kazakhstan's efforts to transform itself from a "land-locked" to "land-linked" country and serve as a land bridge between Asia and Europe.” 

    Kazakhstan’s part in the New Silk Road initiative consists in building a new modern railway system to transport goods from China through Central Asia to their final destinations in the capitals of Europe. Within the project, Kazakhstan plan to invest in its transportation industry over [$20 billion by 2020](http://sputniknews.com/business/20150417/1021019858.html), said Kazakhstan’s deputy minister of investment and development. 

    Kazakhstan - U.S. relations and regional economic goals are aligned to support the State Department-backed [New Silk Road](http://www.state.gov/p/sca/ci/af/newsilkroad/) initiative for Central Asia and Afghanistan. The New Silk Road aims to use energy, transport, trade, communications and infrastructure investment to economically integrate the region, provide regional stability and boost its potential as a transit area between Europe and East Asia.

    South and Central Asia remains one of the least economically integrated regions in the world, presenting an untapped opportunity for investment and human development. As such, the initiative targets to improve this by accelerating the flow of goods, services and people throughout the region to promote cross-border collaboration and trade.

  body: |-
    - Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top 20 oil producers, with the ninth-most proven reserves in the world and about a 2% share in global production. 
    - Kazakhstan holds 30 billion barrels (four billion tons) of proven recoverable oil reserves and potential reserves of 100-110 billion barrels.
    - New projects being developed have led industry experts to estimate that by 2015, Kazakhstan will be one of the top five oil exporters in the world, with three million barrels per day.
    - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).
    - By 2011, Kazakhstan’s extractive industry made up about a quarter of the country’s GDP, while crude oil alone accounted for 60% of all exports. The oil sector currently accounts for more than half of all tax revenues.
    - Kazakhstan has made major investments to develop a Green Energy sector. President Nazarbayev has pledged that 50 percent of Kazakhstan's energy consumption come from green sources by the year 2050.
    - The country has 3% of the world’s raw materials and a natural resource base of over $300,000 per capita, which is among the highest in the world and is twice the level of Russia and higher than Australia.
    - It has 4% of the global iron reserves, 8% of the world’s zinc reserves and 4% of the world’s chrome reserves.

    Today new large-scale projects in the sphere of high processing of our natural resources are taking place.

    1) The Government has began the construction of the first module of the Balkhash Thermal Station with the power of 1320 MW and worth 2.3 billion USD, in order to solve the problem of energy shortages and energy dependency of the southern regions.
    2) One of the largest energy project in Kazakhstan is also the construction of the Moinak hydro-electric power station. The capacity of Bestyubinsk water reservoir is enough to store up to 300 million cubic meters of water. Two powerful hydro-turbines produce 300 megawatt of electric power.

    title: Oil & Gas
    body: |
      Kazakhstan’s oil and gas complex remains the powerhouse of our economy.

      - The share of the oil and gas sector within the country’s GDP has been growing at a steady rate, increasing from 3.7% in 1997 to 14.7% in 2006 and up to 25.8% in 2011.
      - Kazakhstan diversified its export markets and secured its position, thereby has reduced its dependence on any particular export direction.
      - In the early 1990s, President Nazarbayev had the foresight to create a fund, based on the Norwegian model, which preserved oil and gas revenues for our children and our grandchildren. This so-called “fund for future generations” has now accumulated over $47 billion and is the cornerstone to managing and preserving the country’s oil wealth.
      - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).

      The oil and gas sector represents a major dimension of the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral partnership. After all, in 1993, Chevron became the first major Western oil company to invest in Kazakhstan with the creation of TengizChevroil. Over the past twenty two years, Western energy firms and their advanced technologies have been essential to fueling the growth of Kazakhstan’s oil industry and uncovering some of the most challenging offshore, deep-sea energy deposits in the world.

    title: Renewables
    body: |
      - Kazakhstan has significant potential in renewable energy sector with its low population density and access to renewable energy sources such as wind, sun, and water.
      - The UNDP estimates that the potential for wind energy alone exceeds Kazakhstan’s current energy consumption by ten-fold.
      - The government aims for the share of renewable energy in domestic electricity generation to rise to 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
      - By 2020 the country should have 13 wind, 14 hydropower and four solar power plants, as well as a nuclear power plant.
      - In 2013 Kazakhstan adopted legislation establishing feed-in tariffs for renewables, which will be in place for 15 year, and provides capital subsidies.

      Together with Islamic Development Bank, the country has established a renewable energy fund of $50 million that hopes to attract strategic investment flows and expertize into renewable energy sector, particularly wind, solar, biomass and small hydro.

      In 2013 the government has launched a pilot version of the national carbon-trading scheme. In 2017, Kazakhstan will for the first time host the World Expo exhibition, dedicated to ‘Future Energy’. 

      __[Green Bridge](http://gbpp.org/en/)__
      Kazakhstan’s Green Bridge Initiative [was adopted](http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=1006&menu=1348&nr=2237) by the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development and aims to strengthen national and international governance, develop informational infrastructure, boost outreach and education, encourage green business and related technologies, introduce effective financial and economic mechanisms, and the creation of unified standards for the green economy.

      The Green Bridge targets conservation in five core sectors:

      - mountainous and wetland ecosystems,
      - sustainable energy (availability and efficiency),
      - food security,
      - urban infrastructure and transport,
      - adaptation to climate change and natural disasters.

      __[Expo 2017](https://expo2017astana.com/en/)__

      From June 10 to September 10, 2017 Kazakhstan’s Astana will be the first CIS city to host the World's Fair exhibition. For the first time EXPO will be dedicated to ‘Future of Energy’, facilitating discussion of the international community on innovation in energy and presentation of best practices in energy applications by experts. EXPO will make a significant contribution to the development and use of alternative energy sources globally, creating more environmentally-friendly economies as well as provide an impetus for Kazakhstan’s own transition to a green economy.

  title: Oil & Gas
  body: |
    Kazakhstan’s oil and gas complex remains the powerhouse of our economy.

    - The share of the oil and gas sector within the country’s GDP has been growing at a steady rate, increasing from 3.7% in 1997 to 14.7% in 2006 and up to 25.8% in 2011.
    - Kazakhstan diversified its export markets and secured its position, thereby has reduced its dependence on any particular export direction.
    - In the early 1990s, President Nazarbayev had the foresight to create a fund, based on the Norwegian model, which preserved oil and gas revenues for our children and our grandchildren. This so-called “fund for future generations” has now accumulated over $47 billion and is the cornerstone to managing and preserving the country’s oil wealth.
    - Major oil and gas fields and their recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 bln. tons); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels and 1.35 trillion m³ of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (936 mln. to 1.2 bln. tons).

    The oil and gas sector represents a major dimension of the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral partnership. After all, in 1993, Chevron became the first major Western oil company to invest in Kazakhstan with the creation of TengizChevroil. Over the past twenty two years, Western energy firms and their advanced technologies have been essential to fueling the growth of Kazakhstan’s oil industry and uncovering some of the most challenging offshore, deep-sea energy deposits in the world.

  title: Renewables
  body: |
    - Kazakhstan has significant potential in renewable energy sector with its low population density and access to renewable energy sources such as wind, sun, and water.
    - The UNDP estimates that the potential for wind energy alone exceeds Kazakhstan’s current energy consumption by ten-fold.
    - The government aims for the share of renewable energy in domestic electricity generation to rise to 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
    - By 2020 the country should have 13 wind, 14 hydropower and four solar power plants, as well as a nuclear power plant.
    - In 2013 Kazakhstan adopted legislation establishing feed-in tariffs for renewables, which will be in place for 15 year, and provides capital subsidies.

    Together with Islamic Development Bank, the country has established a renewable energy fund of $50 million that hopes to attract strategic investment flows and expertize into renewable energy sector, particularly wind, solar, biomass and small hydro.

    In 2013 the government has launched a pilot version of the national carbon-trading scheme. In 2017, Kazakhstan will for the first time host the World Expo exhibition, dedicated to ‘Future Energy’. 

    __[Green Bridge](http://gbpp.org/en/)__
    Kazakhstan’s Green Bridge Initiative [was adopted](http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=1006&menu=1348&nr=2237) by the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development and aims to strengthen national and international governance, develop informational infrastructure, boost outreach and education, encourage green business and related technologies, introduce effective financial and economic mechanisms, and the creation of unified standards for the green economy.

    The Green Bridge targets conservation in five core sectors:

    - mountainous and wetland ecosystems,
    - sustainable energy (availability and efficiency),
    - food security,
    - urban infrastructure and transport,
    - adaptation to climate change and natural disasters.

    __[Expo 2017](https://expo2017astana.com/en/)__

    After almost three years of stagnation in the Kazakhstani credit market, loans to the economy by banks had been renewed. The volume of  loans by banks increased by 15.7 percent and made up KZT 8.8 billion ($58.7 million). The volume of loans in the national currency increased by 29.6 percent and in foreign currency reduced by 3.4 percent.

    In order to increase the populations’ trust in banks and to activate the depositary market, the amount of individuals’ deposits coverage had been increased to KZT 5 million ($33,367).

    The National Bank carried out an additional capitalization of the Kazakhstan deposits insurance fund. As a result of these measures, deposits were raised by 19.7 percent in 2009 (9.7 percent without the devaluation effect), by 11.6 percent in 2010 and by 14.3 percent in 2011, to KZT 8.4 trillion ($56.0 billion).

  title: Mining & Smelting
  body: |-
    Mining represents 27% of the country’s GDP and has immense growth potential.

    70 elements have been explored and 60 extracted so far in Kazakhstan. Its mineral and resources base consists of 5,004 fields with a net worth of $46 trillion.

    Currently, the Industrialization Map of Kazakhstan includes 61 mining and smelting industry projects, with an investment of KZT 1.5 trillion ($10.0 billion). In 2011, 11 projects brought the economy a new worth of KZT 52.7 billion ($351.9 million) and 2,700 new jobs. The most significant of these include oil and gas, uranium, zinc, lead (2nd largest reserves in the world), manganese (3rd largest reserves in the world), and copper (5th largest reserves in the world).

    In terms of production, Kazakhstan is in third place of production of titanium, seventh for zinc, eighth for lead, thirteenth for iron ore, fifteenth for copper and thirty fifth for steel. Other mining operations in the country focus on tungsten, bohrium, silver, chromites, copper, fluorides, molybdenum, and gold. About 80 percent of all mining industry products are exported to more than 30 countries, making 20 percent of the total exports and 30 percent of the country’s revenues.

    To support the development of the mining and smelting industries, in 2010 the government approved the Mining-Smelting Industry Development Program for 2010-14. The program is aimed at rational and optimal use and development of mineral resources for the purposes of production of high-technology and science-intensive finished products. The government expects 107 percent growth of gross value added for metallurgy products.

  title: Agribusiness
  body: |-
    ![Agriculture](//images.ctfassets.net/3u75lz35gn9w/2LmnpyuGvmw2G4Gcwc2GeS/33808749f78b3bc53b7d11f7004975c8/Agriculture.jpg)

    Agribusiness and agriculture combine to comprise a critical sector of the Kazakh economy. The rich soil and climate (similar to the U.S. state of North and South Dakota and Nebraska) provide ideal conditions for growing wheat, barley, rice, corn, millet and buckwheat and raising livestock - especially American [Black Angus](https://www.inquisitr.com/382988/transplanted-north-dakota-cattle-doing-well-in-kazakhstan/). Kazakhstan’s major crops are wheat, barley, cotton, and rice.  Kazakhstan is one of the top 10 grain exporters in the world, exporting to over 70 countries.

    For a country with a long nomadic history, it is not surprising that stockbreeding is the traditional and dominant agricultural sector. No less than three quarters of all agricultural land is used for grazing. Sheep breeding is predominant, while cattle breeding and the raising of pigs, horses and camels are also well developed. Animal husbandry typically accounts for about 45-50 percent of the production value in agriculture in Kazakhstan. Primary meat products include beef, veal, chicken, horse, lamb, pork and rabbit.

    The livestock sector is gradually growing. Meat production increased by 8% to 270,550 tonnes in 2018. Kazakhstan produced 535,501tonnes of milk in 2018, which is a 10% increase compared to 2017.

    The Government provides subsidized loans to agricultural enterprises, subsidies for machinery upgrades and construction, state-funding of organizations developing veterinary and phytosanitary sectors, the provision of subsidies for industrial energy costs. It also waved import duties on farm equipment, raw materials and spare parts, and exemption from corporate income and property taxes. According to the 2018 data, international investors have tripled their activity in agricultural business since 2004.

    title: Land Code Reforms
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan recently made reforms to the existing agriculture land codes to encourage foreign direct investment into the priority sector. The new codes will drive investment into Kazakhstan's rural communities, create modernized agricultural jobs, increase transparency by making public the details of land auctions, and add up to 15 years to the land leases available to foreign investors. Kazakhstan's land code reforms better position Kazakhstan to support its commitment to [Food Security](http://kazakhstanun.com/kazakhstan-un-security-council/) and providing stability to global food markets.

  title: Transportation & Logistics
  body: |-
    Being sandwiched between Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan boasts of a great transit potential, as there is no alternatives for Asian states to link to Russia and Europe. Relatively diverse landscape and availability of natural stone reserves allow unrestricted development of railways and automobile routes.

    Four international transport corridors cross the territory of Kazakhstan and are formed on the basis of transport infrastructure existing in the country. They are:

    - __Northern Corridor of Trans-Asian Railway Main (TARM)__: Western Europe – China, Korean Peninsula and Japan via Russian and Kazakhstan (section Dostyk – Aktogai - Sayak – Mointy – Astana – Petropavlovsk (Presnogorkovskaya)).
    - __Southern Corridor of TARM__: South-Eastern Europe – China and South-Eastern Asia via Turkey, Iran, Central Asian states and Kazakhstan (section Dostyk – Aktogai – Almaty- Shu – Arys – Saryagash).
    - __TRACECA__: Eastern Europe – Central Asia via the Black Sea, Caucasus and the Caspian Sea (section Dostyk – Almaty – Aktau).
    - __North-South__: Northern Europe – Gulf States via Russia and Iran, with Kazakhstan’s participation in the following sections: sea port Aktau – Ural regions of Russia and Aktau

    Kazakhstan Government has elaborated and approved Strategy of Transport Sector Development of up to 2015; the amount of investments required for construction of respective infrastructure within the 10 years will make up USD 26 billion.

    Ultimate goal of the Transport Strategy is to ensure progressive development of transport and communications complex in line with economic strategy of the state. The Strategy covers 2006-2015 and is supposed to be implemented in two stages: 1st stage – 2006-2011, 2nd stage – 2011-2015.

    The Strategy implementation is expected to ensure bringing of the national transport system to a higher level, and forming of an optimum transport network. Financing of the infrastructure on the self-sufficiency principles will allow accommodating resources for its further sustainable development and maintenance at a high technical level.

    On Feburary 1, 2016 a new container train service on the China-Iran route via Kazakhstan was launched. The 9,000-kilometre route runs from the city of Yiwu (Zhejiang Province, East China) through the Alashankou-Dostyk border crossing to Kazakhstan’s new Zhezkazgan-Beineu and Uzen-Bolashak lines and via Turkmenistan’s railway network to Tehran. With only a 10-day transit time, the 40-foot containers on the train can travel much faster overland than by sea, which takes from 25 – 30 days. In establishing the new service, the railway companies of China, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran collaborated to identify logistics solutions needed to speed up the delivery of cargo from East China to Persian Gulf markets.

  title: 'Chemicals '
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan is well-positioned to develop a chemical production sector through its wealth of raw materials. Petroleum-related downstream products, such as phosphates and sulfuric acid, are part of this focus. The pharmaceutical sector will take advantage of the high level of scientific and educational development in the country’s southeast area.

    With vast oil reserves and raw chemical material deposits, Kazakhstan has huge growth potential in the petrochemical industry. In 2004, the government adopted the “__Program for development of the petrochemical industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2008-2013__,” pursuant to which it has started constructing the National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark in Atyrau that will convert the resources from Tengiz and Kashagan oil fields to high-value petrochemical products for export and domestic consumption.

  title: Information Technology (ICT)
  body: |-
    Technological innovation is at the forefront of efforts to diversify Kazakhstan’s economy. The government aims to become a major technological hub in Central Asia, focusing on ICT.

    Kazakhstan’s strategic location between China and Europe allows for it to play a critical linking role between these economic giants, as well as acting as the communications hub for fast-growing Central Asia.

    __The Park of Information Technologies in Alatau__, a special economic zone, has been established to facilitate transfer of technology and foster innovation.

    The local demand for high-quality telecommunication infrastructure and services, particularly Internet access and data transfer services, is increasing with rapid economic and social progress. There is a demonstrated market demand for a more agile technological infrastructure, included upgraded telecommunications networks in rural and urban areas and enhancing broadband Internet access.

    While there are international firms working on these projects, Kazakhstan is interested in attracting the high-tech expertise of U.S. companies.

  body: |-
    The production of machine equipment is vital to Kazakhstan’s development and relates to several other core economic goals, such as the growth of the energy and mining sectors as well as infrastructure.

    Manufacturing that serves the country’s booming construction sector is also a high-growth opportunity and the gross value-added amount for Kazakhstan’s industrial engineering sector in all of 2008 was equaled in the first half of 2013, a sign of the machinery sector’s booming growth.

    Machinery constitutes an important share of the Kazakhstan’s non-agricultural imports from the US. In 2013, machinery represented $333 million of the non-agriculture imports from the US (which totaled $882 million the same year).

  body: "Kazakhstan is the most efficient and investment-friendly transit hub for
    the greater Eurasia region. By 2020 the country aims to become a key logistics
    hub for Eurasia and beyond by developing transportation and export centers on
    the territory. Kazakhstan and the US have established a robust trade relationship
    that has generated skilled jobs in both countries. Kazakhstan imports annully
    from the U.S. high tech medical equipment, industrial machinery and livestock.

    \n__Proximity to Large Markets and Market Capacity__\n\nKazakhstan is the most
    efficient and investment-friendly transit hub for the greater Eurasia region.
    By 2020 the country aims to become a key logistics hub for Eurasia and beyond
    by developing transportation and export centers on the territory. Kazakhstan is
    setting up the __Western Europe - Western China International Transportation Corridor__,
    which will cut ground transportation time from China to Europe in third (from
    30 to 10 days) and multiply the transit cargo volume by 1,000%, to 170 million
    tons from the current 16 million tons, allowing the country to jump from the 86th
    spot on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index to 40th place. This will
    increase Kazakhstan’s GDP by 68% above a 2010 baseline while also boosting the
    GDP of neighboring countries by 43%, providing an additional boost to Kazakhstan’s
    export economy. Kazakhstan’s integration into the EEU has already reduced border
    crossing times and gives Kazakhstan access to a wider market of more than 171
    million people with $2.7 trillion annual GDP.\n\n__Kazakhstan is the Eurasian
    Hub __\n\nThe continental bridge for goods that move from East and West, South
    to North. By 2020 the country aims to become a key transit hub for Eurasia and
    beyond by developing transportation, logistics, and export centers on the territory
    and neighboring foreign countries. Kazakhstan is setting up the Western Europe
    - Western China International Transportation Corridor, which will cut the transportation
    time from China to Europe in third (from 30 to 10 days), will multiply the transit
    cargo volume by 1,000 percent, to 170mil tons from the current 16mil, allowing
    the country to jump from the current 86th spot on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance
    Index to 40th place by increasing cargo transport. This will increase Kazakhstan’s
    GDP by 68 per cent above the 2010 baseline, while boosting the GDP of neighboring
    countries by 43 per cent. Kazakhstan’s integration into the customs union with
    Russia and Belarus, which took full effect in January 2012, has cut border-crossing
    time in half and significantly reduced pilferage. The deeper integration under
    the umbrella of the __Eurasian Economic Union__ (EEU) promises to further reduce
    transportation costs and transaction costs.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content:
    center;\"><img src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/infographics/nasdaq-aifc.png\"
    style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n\nEEU builds on the successes of
    the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market for
    more than 171 million people with $2.7tn annual GDP. The objective of the union
    is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish a common energy
    market, and enable the free movement of people within the community. With the
    current size of 76.8mil people, the middle class accounts for around 30 per cent
    of total population in Kazakhstan and more than 55 per cent in Russia. Both are
    both growing at an annual rate of 7 per cent, which makes both of them attractive
    for importation of consumer goods. Russia is the 6th biggest middle class consumer
    in the world.\n\nFor many investors Kazakhstan is a great springboard for expanding
    not only into the member countries of EEU but also the entire Central Asian region.
    It shares borders with all the other Central Asian countries and lies close to
    the Caucasus region. Central Asia and Caucasus offer a combined disposable income
    of over $260 billion.\nProjects in the transportation and energy sectors supported
    by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program will give additional
    impetus to the development of intra-regional trade relations as well as connectivity
    with China and Europe. "

    title: Eurasian Economic Union
    body: |-
      The Eurasian Economic Union represents the opening of new economic opportunities without sacrificing political independence. The EEU builds on the economic success of the Customs Union, and the EEU is in line with Kazakhstan's multi-vector foreign policy. Kazakhstan unequivocally maintains the EEU will not erode the country's political independence, which is critical to Kazakhstan’s priorities and multi-vector orientation. The EEU in its final form serves to advance Kazakhstan’s economic integration with the European Union, the United States, China and Latin America.

      ### Facts about the EEU:

      - The EEU builds on the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market with the total GDP of $1.9 TN. The Member-States of the Eurasian Economic Union are the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation. The objective of the union is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish a common energy market, and enable the free movement of people within the community.
      - The EEU is an economic, not political union. It will not have any supra-national authority, over the sovereign states. Kazakhstan has made it clear that it will not support any supra-national political bodies, such as an EEU Parliament.
      - No country will dominate the decision-making process in the Union as each country has an equal vote as well as the right to veto. Resolutions will be based on the ruling of the majority.
      - As in the case of the EU, the member countries have various predispositions and concerns reflecting their endowments and power. Kazakh officials favor an economic association (much like UK’s disposition to the EU) while Belarus and Russia support stronger and deeper political and economic union (much like Germany). Given Kazakhstan’s insistence that EEU will not go beyond economic union, it is unlikely that integration will proceed further than the currently agreed-to format.
      - The Union is created to facilitate trade, both inside of the Union and with outside economies – not to act as a barrier to trade.
      - As a result of the creation of a new business environment and conditions for interaction between different businesses, all countries will see structural benefits that manifest themselves in the use of workforce, production and infrastructural cooperation and mutual investments. According to analysts, this will generate up to 25 per cent growth in member states by 2030 (15 years after the creation of the economic space), or around $600bn.

    title: WTO Accession
    body: |-
      Accession to the WTO has been a foreign policy priority for Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991. Kazakhstan gained WTO membership in 2015.  Kazakhstan worked to create the Eurasian Economic Union prior to WTO membership, which is viewed as a practical realization of the Kazakh President’s idea concerning the economic integration of Eurasian countries similar to the European Union announced by him in the mid-1990s.

      It is well known that a unified customs territory is an integral step towards that high level of economic integration. Neither in negotiations on the WTO, nor in negotiations on the Customs Union did Kazakhstan ever renounce its interests, and the country considers both processes to be mutually complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Therefore, the processes of Eurasian integration and WTO accession have always been in parallel.

      __WTO advances Kazakhstan’s Economic Interests__

      Kazakhstan's goal is further strengthening integration among global economies, and facilitate trade and investment freely among WTO countries.  Elimination of internal customs borders and harmonization of legislation of the WTO members is already creating additional benefits for the trading partners by insuring free circulation of goods between the Eurasian countries and thus, providing traders and investors with bigger economic space and more attractive market for potential investors.
      Kazakhstan's Regional Trade Agreements

      Kazakhstan’s decision on creating the EEU with Russia and Belarus was based solely on the country’s own economic interests including the following factors:

      - __Mineral Reserves.__ Kazakhstan has the sixth largest mineral reserves in the world and is a major player in the energy markets. A major portion of mineral and energy resources produced in Kazakhstan is exported to external markets. One of the main tasks of the Government of Kazakhstan is development of nonextractive sectors and diversification of the economy and export promotion of highly marketable products. A unified customs tariff within the Customs Union would expand the regional market and promote Kazakhstan’s exports. Future customs tariff policy within the Customs Union will allow the import of raw materials and equipment under low custom duties within the development of investment projects. Establishment of the Customs Union would entail creation of a unified commodity market with a total GDP of about $2 trillion (2008) and a population of 180 million people, as well as create preferential conditions within the Customs Union. Such a large market within a unified customs territory would make Kazakhstan even more attractive for foreign investors who have considered Kazakhstan as one of the most attractive markets in our part of the world.
      - __Geopolitical Realities.__ Kazakhstan is the largest land-locked country in the world and much of its foreign trade depends on the routes that go through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the Customs Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory) transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading relations, particularly with the European Union, are implemented through the transit of the territory of Russia.
      - __Global Financial Crisis.__ The crisis has thinned down the flow of FDIs, decreased trade turnover, led to the introduction of protectionist mechanisms by some trade partners, and seriously damaged the economies of neighboring states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more active and joint approach to further integrate and modernize the regional economy. Creation of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient use of the limited financial resources due to the global economic crisis. It will also provide a rationale for companies to use available resources to increase their production capacity.

      WTO accession provides sizable benefits for Kazakhstan and serves its long-term economic priorities. The decision was based on the need to meet Kazakhstan’s national economic interests including:

      - Unimpeded access to global markets
      - Expanding trade with large neighboring economies, such as Russia and China
      - Accelerated economic diversification by moving towards service and technology based economy.

      Therefore, any speculations suggesting political motivation behind the decision are baseless.

      __WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel__

      As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

      Kazakhstan’s team reassured American counterparts that the accession to the WTO has always been top priority for Kazakhstan’s foreign policy. The United States welcomes progress achieved by Kazakhstan in bringing its legislation in compliance with the WTO rules and supports its continuous trade liberalization process. In particular, such issues as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property rights and veterinary certificates are at the final stage of negotiations.

      Kazakhstan has finalized negotiations with the Unites States on Goods market access. Minister of Economic Development and Trade Zhanar Aitzhanova signed a document with U.S. Representative to the WTO Michael Punke in Geneva.

            people, as well as create preferential conditions within the Customs Union.
            Such a large market within a unified customs territory would make Kazakhstan
            even more attractive for foreign investors who have considered Kazakhstan
            as one of the most attractive markets in our part of the world.

          value: Geopolitical Realities. Kazakhstan is the largest land-locked country
            in the world and much of its foreign trade depends on the routes that
            go through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the Customs
            Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory)
            transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading
            relations, particularly with the European Union, are implemented through
            the transit of the territory of Russia.

          value: Global Financial Crisis. The crisis has thinned down the flow of
            FDIs, decreased trade turnover, led to the introduction of protectionist
            mechanisms by some trade partners, and seriously damaged the economies
            of neighboring states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more
            active and joint approach to further integrate and modernize the regional
            economy. Creation of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient use
            of the limited financial resources due to the global economic crisis.
            It will also provide a rationale for companies to use available resources
            to increase their production capacity.

            WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel
            As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

    title: Astana International Finance Centre
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan enters a new phase of the development after a period of high economic growth. The crisis of 2007-2009 was successfully overcome through the use of accumulated resources. Sovereign wealth funds, established in the previous years, played a major role in the economic development. With the falling prices for the country's main export commodities, new approaches to public policy are necessary. In particular, diversification of economy, better management of the accumulated funds and assets, as well as the development of a financial services market have become important. At the same time, the country's integration into regional cooperation organisations and the Eurasian Economic Union creates conditions for accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan into the global financial system. 

      Five institutional reforms of the Head of State and Hundred Concrete Steps Program to implement these reforms (hereinafter – Plan of the Nation) have become a new starting point in the development of Kazakhstan. As part of the Plan of the Nation, [Astana International Financial Centre](http://www.aifc.kz/) (hereinafter – AIFC) was established at the order of the President of Republic of Kazakhstan with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition (hereinafter – EXPO-2017) infrastructure. 

      A Constitutional Law providing favourable environment for the AIFC participants was passed for a successful launch of the AIFC. The main goal of AIFC, like of any other state reform, is to improve welfare of Kazakhstan residents. Various aspects of the AIFC shall allow improving the approaches to managing sovereign wealth funds and facilitating the transfer of foreign knowledge and technology to the country, thus, ensuring an increase and the development of human capital. The slowdown of business cycles in the country due to the deteriorating conditions in foreign markets and unfavourable geopolitical situation in the region, only justifies the need for a financial centre - it is important now more than ever to attract new investments in the financial capital, as well as in technology and human capital. The initiative to establish an international financial centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development. 

      In order to establish AIFC as a local centre of expertise with a developed capital market and later to develop it into a regional platform for financial intermediation, the strategy for the development of AIFC has been developed until 2021, inclusive. Implementing the initial phase of the development of the AIFC shall serve as a solid foundation for the realisation of the subsequent phases, namely, development into a regional financial centre, and eventually, into an international financial centre. The strategy for the development of AIFC shall be reviewed upon the implementation of each phase of the development due to a change of goals and objectives.

  title: Eurasian Economic Union
  body: |-
    The Eurasian Economic Union represents the opening of new economic opportunities without sacrificing political independence. The EEU builds on the economic success of the Customs Union, and the EEU is in line with Kazakhstan's multi-vector foreign policy. Kazakhstan unequivocally maintains the EEU will not erode the country's political independence, which is critical to Kazakhstan’s priorities and multi-vector orientation. The EEU in its final form serves to advance Kazakhstan’s economic integration with the European Union, the United States, China and Latin America.

    ### Facts about the EEU:

    - The EEU builds on the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market with the total GDP of $1.9 TN. The Member-States of the Eurasian Economic Union are the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation. The objective of the union is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish a common energy market, and enable the free movement of people within the community.
    - The EEU is an economic, not political union. It will not have any supra-national authority, over the sovereign states. Kazakhstan has made it clear that it will not support any supra-national political bodies, such as an EEU Parliament.
    - No country will dominate the decision-making process in the Union as each country has an equal vote as well as the right to veto. Resolutions will be based on the ruling of the majority.
    - As in the case of the EU, the member countries have various predispositions and concerns reflecting their endowments and power. Kazakh officials favor an economic association (much like UK’s disposition to the EU) while Belarus and Russia support stronger and deeper political and economic union (much like Germany). Given Kazakhstan’s insistence that EEU will not go beyond economic union, it is unlikely that integration will proceed further than the currently agreed-to format.
    - The Union is created to facilitate trade, both inside of the Union and with outside economies – not to act as a barrier to trade.
    - As a result of the creation of a new business environment and conditions for interaction between different businesses, all countries will see structural benefits that manifest themselves in the use of workforce, production and infrastructural cooperation and mutual investments. According to analysts, this will generate up to 25 per cent growth in member states by 2030 (15 years after the creation of the economic space), or around $600bn.

  title: WTO Accession
  body: |-
    Accession to the WTO has been a foreign policy priority for Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991. Kazakhstan gained WTO membership in 2015.  Kazakhstan worked to create the Eurasian Economic Union prior to WTO membership, which is viewed as a practical realization of the Kazakh President’s idea concerning the economic integration of Eurasian countries similar to the European Union announced by him in the mid-1990s.

    It is well known that a unified customs territory is an integral step towards that high level of economic integration. Neither in negotiations on the WTO, nor in negotiations on the Customs Union did Kazakhstan ever renounce its interests, and the country considers both processes to be mutually complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Therefore, the processes of Eurasian integration and WTO accession have always been in parallel.

    __WTO advances Kazakhstan’s Economic Interests__

    Kazakhstan's goal is further strengthening integration among global economies, and facilitate trade and investment freely among WTO countries.  Elimination of internal customs borders and harmonization of legislation of the WTO members is already creating additional benefits for the trading partners by insuring free circulation of goods between the Eurasian countries and thus, providing traders and investors with bigger economic space and more attractive market for potential investors.
    Kazakhstan's Regional Trade Agreements

    Kazakhstan’s decision on creating the EEU with Russia and Belarus was based solely on the country’s own economic interests including the following factors:

    - __Mineral Reserves.__ Kazakhstan has the sixth largest mineral reserves in the world and is a major player in the energy markets. A major portion of mineral and energy resources produced in Kazakhstan is exported to external markets. One of the main tasks of the Government of Kazakhstan is development of nonextractive sectors and diversification of the economy and export promotion of highly marketable products. A unified customs tariff within the Customs Union would expand the regional market and promote Kazakhstan’s exports. Future customs tariff policy within the Customs Union will allow the import of raw materials and equipment under low custom duties within the development of investment projects. Establishment of the Customs Union would entail creation of a unified commodity market with a total GDP of about $2 trillion (2008) and a population of 180 million people, as well as create preferential conditions within the Customs Union. Such a large market within a unified customs territory would make Kazakhstan even more attractive for foreign investors who have considered Kazakhstan as one of the most attractive markets in our part of the world.
    - __Geopolitical Realities.__ Kazakhstan is the largest land-locked country in the world and much of its foreign trade depends on the routes that go through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the Customs Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory) transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading relations, particularly with the European Union, are implemented through the transit of the territory of Russia.
    - __Global Financial Crisis.__ The crisis has thinned down the flow of FDIs, decreased trade turnover, led to the introduction of protectionist mechanisms by some trade partners, and seriously damaged the economies of neighboring states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more active and joint approach to further integrate and modernize the regional economy. Creation of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient use of the limited financial resources due to the global economic crisis. It will also provide a rationale for companies to use available resources to increase their production capacity.

    WTO accession provides sizable benefits for Kazakhstan and serves its long-term economic priorities. The decision was based on the need to meet Kazakhstan’s national economic interests including:

    - Unimpeded access to global markets
    - Expanding trade with large neighboring economies, such as Russia and China
    - Accelerated economic diversification by moving towards service and technology based economy.

    Therefore, any speculations suggesting political motivation behind the decision are baseless.

    __WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel__

    As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

    Kazakhstan’s team reassured American counterparts that the accession to the WTO has always been top priority for Kazakhstan’s foreign policy. The United States welcomes progress achieved by Kazakhstan in bringing its legislation in compliance with the WTO rules and supports its continuous trade liberalization process. In particular, such issues as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property rights and veterinary certificates are at the final stage of negotiations.

    Kazakhstan has finalized negotiations with the Unites States on Goods market access. Minister of Economic Development and Trade Zhanar Aitzhanova signed a document with U.S. Representative to the WTO Michael Punke in Geneva.

        value: Mineral Reserves. Kazakhstan has the sixth largest mineral reserves
          in the world and is a major player in the energy markets. A major portion
          of mineral and energy resources produced in Kazakhstan is exported to external
          markets. One of the main tasks of the Government of Kazakhstan is development
          of nonextractive sectors and diversification of the economy and export promotion
          of highly marketable products. A unified customs tariff within the Customs
          Union would expand the regional market and promote Kazakhstan’s exports.
          Future customs tariff policy within the Customs Union will allow the import
          of raw materials and equipment under low custom duties within the development
          of investment projects. Establishment of the Customs Union would entail
          creation of a unified commodity market with a total GDP of about $2 trillion
          (2008) and a population of 180 million people, as well as create preferential
          conditions within the Customs Union. Such a large market within a unified
          customs territory would make Kazakhstan even more attractive for foreign
          investors who have considered Kazakhstan as one of the most attractive markets
          in our part of the world.

        value: Geopolitical Realities. Kazakhstan is the largest land-locked country
          in the world and much of its foreign trade depends on the routes that go
          through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the Customs
          Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory)
          transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading relations,
          particularly with the European Union, are implemented through the transit
          of the territory of Russia.

        value: Global Financial Crisis. The crisis has thinned down the flow of FDIs,
          decreased trade turnover, led to the introduction of protectionist mechanisms
          by some trade partners, and seriously damaged the economies of neighboring
          states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more active and joint
          approach to further integrate and modernize the regional economy. Creation
          of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient use of the limited financial
          resources due to the global economic crisis. It will also provide a rationale
          for companies to use available resources to increase their production capacity.

          WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel
          As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

  title: Astana International Finance Centre
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan enters a new phase of the development after a period of high economic growth. The crisis of 2007-2009 was successfully overcome through the use of accumulated resources. Sovereign wealth funds, established in the previous years, played a major role in the economic development. With the falling prices for the country's main export commodities, new approaches to public policy are necessary. In particular, diversification of economy, better management of the accumulated funds and assets, as well as the development of a financial services market have become important. At the same time, the country's integration into regional cooperation organisations and the Eurasian Economic Union creates conditions for accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan into the global financial system. 

    Five institutional reforms of the Head of State and Hundred Concrete Steps Program to implement these reforms (hereinafter – Plan of the Nation) have become a new starting point in the development of Kazakhstan. As part of the Plan of the Nation, [Astana International Financial Centre](http://www.aifc.kz/) (hereinafter – AIFC) was established at the order of the President of Republic of Kazakhstan with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition (hereinafter – EXPO-2017) infrastructure. 

    A Constitutional Law providing favourable environment for the AIFC participants was passed for a successful launch of the AIFC. The main goal of AIFC, like of any other state reform, is to improve welfare of Kazakhstan residents. Various aspects of the AIFC shall allow improving the approaches to managing sovereign wealth funds and facilitating the transfer of foreign knowledge and technology to the country, thus, ensuring an increase and the development of human capital. The slowdown of business cycles in the country due to the deteriorating conditions in foreign markets and unfavourable geopolitical situation in the region, only justifies the need for a financial centre - it is important now more than ever to attract new investments in the financial capital, as well as in technology and human capital. The initiative to establish an international financial centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development. 

    In order to establish AIFC as a local centre of expertise with a developed capital market and later to develop it into a regional platform for financial intermediation, the strategy for the development of AIFC has been developed until 2021, inclusive. Implementing the initial phase of the development of the AIFC shall serve as a solid foundation for the realisation of the subsequent phases, namely, development into a regional financial centre, and eventually, into an international financial centre. The strategy for the development of AIFC shall be reviewed upon the implementation of each phase of the development due to a change of goals and objectives.

  title: Doing Business
  body: |-
    The Government of Kazakhstan has made significant efforts to remove bureaucratic obstacles to investment and the creation of an attractive business environment, which has been consistently reflected in the last four editions of the World Bank’s Doing Business report as well as other internationally recognized indices.  

    <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/global-rankings/" width="100%" height="700px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    The Constitution affords foreign investors the same rights and obligations as Kazakh nationals. The Investment Code guarantees foreign firms equality between local and foreign investors, protection of investor’s rights, arbitration of disputes, guarantees against nationalization and affirms the right to repatriate profits. Thanks to these, the country ranks 22nd in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank. Foreign firms invest in almost all sectors of the economy.

    The country has a comprehensive system promoting inflow of FDI into domestic-oriented production and export-oriented local production. The government provides investment preferences such as exemptions from customs duties, state grants in kind, privileges relating to land tax and property tax for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects, and industrial privileges for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects in residential areas with a low level of social economic development.

    In 2019, FDI amounted to almost $25 billion, the equivalent of 10% of GDP, and has brought new technology and jobs for domestic suppliers and subcontractors and has generated new types of employment and training for Kazakhs. The majority of FDI has targeted the oil, gas and mining sectors and associated services, so the government puts a large emphasis on encouraging investment in industries other than oil & gas and mining as part of its 2050 Strategy. To eliminate the dependence on resource extraction industries, the government adopted plans to focus on diversification of economy to become knowledge-based modern economy.

    The government's efforts to strengthen the state's fiscal balance, reduce national debt, and aid the recovery of the banking sector following the 2007-08 crisis prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade Kazakhstan's sovereign rating to BBB + with a stable outlook in November 2012. Kazakhstan’s progressive, pro-business laws also support the growth of foreign investment and stronger economic growth. Doing business in Kazakhstan becomes easier and more inviting for foreign investors each year.

  title: SMEs & Entrepreneurship
  body: |-
    President Nazarbayev emphasizes the importance of the development of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and Kazakhstan has implemented many initiatives and schemes to support SMEs in the country.

    Under the ‘Road Map for Business 2020’ small and medium-sized enterprises will be provided with significant state support, including subsidized interest on loans, loan guarantees, assistance in developing production (industrial) infrastructure, services to support businesses (consulting, legal, actuarial, and other), and training of personnel.

    The President’s office has a very strong focus on getting employment generation in SME activities. For that they have crafted incentive measures for attracting and embedding FDI, including:

    - supporting network/institutional capacity
    - organizing supply chains in clusters and generate critical mass to engage more effectively with FDI

    President Nazarbayev announced in 2014 a program allocating 1 trillion tenge ($5.5 billion) from the National Fund of Kazakhstan to support industrial policy, banking sector, and small and medium sized enterprises. The implementation of the program will be supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), based on a framework agreement on co-financing both sides signed in May 2014.

    Kazakhstan has also been working with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to support SMEs. The Kazakh government has provided donor funding to the EBRD’s Small Business Support program, which provides advisory services to enterprises throughout the country. EBRD provided 15 billion tenge to Kazakh SMEs through a loan to Sberbank.

  title: Anti-corruption
  body: "Fighting corruption is one of the priorities of President Tokayev and is
    fundamental to Kazakhstan’s 100 Concrete Steps programme, the massive reform project
    intended to accelerate the country’s development, and realization of Kazakhstan
    2050 Strategy goals. Kazakhstan has developed an effective legal and institutional
    platform to facilitate the anti-corruption policies. The Civil Service Affairs
    and Anti-Corruption Agency works on detecting and stopping corruption offenses
    in all spheres. \n\nPresident Tokayev [signed a law](https://astanatimes.com/2019/12/tokayev-signs-law-making-ministers-and-governors-responsible-for-corruption-among-subordinates/)
    in December 2019 making ministers and akims (governors) responsible for corruption
    among their direct subordinates Nov. 28. The law introduces amendments that will
    oblige ministers and governors to resign if the top officials in their institutions
    are found guilty of corruption.\n\nKazakhstan's National Bureau of Anti-Corruption
    has established close cooperation with the United States, the United Nations (UNO),
    the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization
    for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Transparency International and
    others. Kazakhstan has pledged to provide information on anticorruption measures,
    involve NGOs in anticorruption policies and continue to develop an anti-corruption
    culture. The Modern Anti-Corruption Standards and Development of International
    Cooperation [international conference](https://www.iaca.int/medias/news/974-iaca-emphasizes-international-cooperation-at-astana-anti-corruption-conference.html)

    ### Invest in Kazakhstan
    Kazakhstan's Investment Code guarantees foreign firms equality between local and foreign investors, protection of investor’s rights, arbitration of disputes, guarantees against nationalization and the right to repatriate profits.

    __Kazakhstan ranks 22nd in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank.__

    Kazakhstan has institutions to promote and support investment, including KazNexInvest and the Foreign Investors’ Council, and now plans to establish a new role of an investment ombudsman to help facilitate communication between investors and the government and help investors address their issues. In recent years, the government has also used joint ventures as an effective instrument to bring in foreign expertize and capital it needs to co-fund industries such as construction, logistics, petrochemicals, manufacturing and IT.

    <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/investment-incentives-benefits/" width="100%" height="500px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    __Incentives for Priority Projects__

    Kazakhstan has established a highly preferential regime for those investment projects classified as “priority investment projects”. The primary criterion for a Project is investment of not less than approx. USD 20 million in one of the areas specified by the Government.

    Those who invest in Kazakhstan and conclude an investment contract for a Project with the authorized body (currently the Investments Committee under the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies), may enjoy the following advantages (as specifically set out in an investment contract):

    __1) exemption from corporate income tax (20%) for up to 10 years;__

    __2) exemption from land tax for up to 10 years;__

    __3) exemption from property tax for up to 8 years from the date when fixed assets (e.g., a plant) are commissioned (only for those assets which were commissioned for the first time);__

    __4) reimbursement of up to 30 percent of actual expenses on construction works and purchase of equipment (so-called “investment subsidy” (*4)) on the basis of documentary evidence after full commissioning. To apply for an investment subsidy, an applicant must also provide a feasibility study approved by the state expertise. The Government will approve the rules on granting investment subsidies;__

    __5) exemption from the need to obtain work permits for foreign workers of the legal entity holding the investment contract, its contractors and subcontractors in the area of research and design activities, engineering services and construction works. Such exemption is valid until the expiration of 1 year from the date of commissioning. The list of professions and number of attracted staff is set out in the investment contract;__

    __6) stability with regard to the above tax preferences and “work permits-free” regime;__

    __7) interaction with the Investments Committee under the principle of “one window”. An investor shall only file an application to the Investments Committee with related documents and negotiate further with the Committee regarding conditions of the investment contract;__

    __8) simplified procedure for obtaining land plots for a Project;__

    __9) assistance from the Investments Committee with regard to obtaining a guaranteed order(s) from national state-owned companies;__

    __10) (this preference existed earlier and remains valid) exemption from customs fees for the import of technological equipment and spare parts, for the period of an investment contract, but not more than 5 years.__

  title: Investment Policy
  body: "Due to political and economic stability in Kazakhstan, the abundance of natural
    resources, as well as high annual economic growth over the past several years,
    foreign investors continue invest in Kazakhstan and view it as a favorable place
    to do business.\nOne of the most important issues to foreign investors is the
    repatriation of their profits and the tax implications of their income. Civil
    legislation allows foreign investors to operate in Kazakhstan through either a
    local branch of a foreign company or a local subsidiary established as an independent
    legal entity under the laws of Kazakhstan. Naturally, a foreign investor should
    determine which type of investment structure is preferable.\n\n### Foreign Investors’
    Council\nThe [Foreign Investors’ Council (FIC)](https://fic.kz/eng/) is an advisory
    body established by the Order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan to
    promote direct dialogue between the government and those who invest in Kazakhstan
    in order to efficiently address key issues related to their investment activities
    in the country, to improve the investment climate of Kazakhstan for the benefit
    of foreign investors, local and national companies, the economic development and
    wealth of the country and its people.\n\nThe FIC is chaired by the President of
    the Republic of Kazakhstan, who supervises its activities, including approval
    of the Agenda and chairmanship at the Council's plenary sessions.\n\n### The major
    objectives of the FIC \nDeveloping and submitting recommendations to the President
    and Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on key investment and economic development
    issues. Analyzing and discussing other core investment policy issues upon the
    instruction of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan is represented
    in the Council by the following government officials: Prime Minister, Chairman
    of the National Bank, Deputy Head of the President’s Administration, Deputy Prime-Minister,
    Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Industry and New Technologies, Minister
    of Finance, Minister of Economic Development and Trade, and Head of the Executive
    Body of the Council (Chairman of the Committee on Investments of the Ministry
    of Industry and New Technologies). \n\nThe foreign side of the Council is represented
    by top managers of international organizations, economic and financial institutions,
    foreign companies and corporations. The Plenary Sessions of the Council are conducted
    once or twice a year. For more information about current members of the FIC, please
    visit www.fic.kz.\nInvestment Ombudsman\n\nKazakhstan is putting in its best efforts
    to ensure the continuing improvement of its business and investment climate. The
    establishment of a task force on the protection of rights of foreign investors,
    the so-called “investment ombudsman”, is the most recent example of those efforts. \n\nThe
    institution of Investment Ombudsman was established in the Law on Investment adopted
    in 2014. In December 2015, Minister of Investment and Development Asset Issekeshev
    was appointed as the the Investment Ombudsman of Kazakhstan. Issekeshev began
    his duties January 1, 2016. \n\nThe institution is based on international best
    practices, in particular on the successful experience of South Korea where this

        value: One of the most important issues to foreign investors is the repatriation
          of their profits and the tax implications of their income. Civil legislation
          allows foreign investors to operate in Kazakhstan through either a local
          branch of a foreign company or a local subsidiary established as an independent
          legal entity under the laws of Kazakhstan. Naturally, a foreign investor
          should determine which type of investment structure is preferable.

    title: Nurly Zhol
    body: |
      First [President Nursultan Nazarbayev](http://kazakhstan-president.com/) in November 2014 announced a robust domestic stimulus policy titled ‘Nurly Zhol’ (Bright Path) that will drive state and foreign direct investment into critical infrastructure and priority sectors and drive economic growth. Nurly Zhol will total around $9 billion U.S. dollars and help to shift productivity towards agribusiness, manufacturing, trade and logistics, tourism, information technology and finance, and away from the oil sector. Importantly, Nurly Zhol will increase liquidity in the loans to small and medium sized business and domestic exporters. Nurly Zhol forecasts 4,500 new jobs by supporting SME growth.

      __Nurly Zhol targets seven areas of investment:__

      1. Development of transport and logistics infrastructure. Main road projects include those linking China to Western Europe, and Astana to Almaty. A logistics hub is being created in the east of the country, while marine infrastructure is being developed in the west.
      2. Development of industrial infrastructure. This includes the completion of infrastructure in existing special economic zones, and the construction of new industrial zones. The development of tourism infrastructure is expected to create many jobs.
      3. Development of energy infrastructure. The focus is on the construction of high-voltage lines spanning Ekibastuz, Semey and Ust-Kamenogorsk, and Semey to Aktogay, Taldykorgan and Almaty, with a view to ensuring a balanced energy supply.
      4. Modernization of public utilities infrastructure, and water and heat supply networks. In addition to the funds already budgeted for the modernization of heat and water supply systems, up to $540 million will be dedicated each year to accelerating the upgrades.
      5. Strengthening of housing infrastructure. Social housing will be constructed and made available for long-term rent with the right to buy. Low-interest loans and low mortgage interest will help make housing more affordable.
      6. Development of social infrastructure. An additional 20 billion tenge is being spent to reduce the deficit of kindergarten places. Ten higher-education institutions will also receive additional funding.
      7.  Support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and business activities. Loans totaling $837 million will help increase the output of the SME sector to 50 per cent of GDP by 2050.

      ### “KAZAKHSTAN-2050′′ STRATEGY: NEW POLITICAL COURSE OF THE ESTABLISHED STATE

      __The goal: preserving the nation’s high rate of economic growth.__

      In his [annual State-of-the-Nation address](http://strategy2050.kz/en/page/message_text2014/), President Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined a new strategy for Kazakhstan’s development through 2050, which is designed to serve as a coherent  continuation of the Kazakhstan-2030 Strategy.

      In his speech delivered on the eve of the country’s Independence Day, Nazarbayev announced  a series of milestone reforms in all spheres of the nation’s life. He laid out a strategy for the country, calling for better governance, improvement of the welfare and tax systems, support for small- and medium-sized businesses, and development of infrastructure.

      Currently ranked as the 51st most competitive country in the world, Kazakhstan, according to Nazarbayev, should be ranked among the 30 most advanced nations by 2050. To do so, Kazakhstan will need to integrate its economy into the global and regional environments by capitalizing on its transit potential and bolstering information technology capabilities.

      As an oil-rich country and a reliable international partner, Kazakhstan will lift the existing subsoil use moratorium in an effort to become “a regional magnet for investment.” This would be done in exchange for advanced technologies and the creation of new production.

      The President also tasked the government to increase the share of agriculture of the country’s GDP fivefold by 2050 through a series of measures including government stimulus packages. Nazarbayev asked the government to lift all licenses and permits not directly affecting safety in the first half of 2013. He also said it was necessary to redistribute responsibilities so a second wave of privatization of non-strategic enterprises can begin.

    title: SPAIID
    body: |-
      The State Program for Accelerated Industrial Innovative Development (SPAIID)is a short-term plan announced in 2010 to apply through 2014. Developed at the encouragement of President Nazarbayev in his 2010 State of the Nation Address, the program focuses on industrial and infrastructure development while also boosting diversification through small- to medium-sized businesses. 

      The program reveals the country’s strategy for diversification and involves the key approaches laid out in the Strategy of Industrial and Innovation Development for 2003-2015, and of the program “30 Corporate Leaders of Kazakhstan,” as well as other policy documents in the field of industrialization.

      For the period until 2015, the main priority of for industrialization will be the implementation of major investment projects in the traditional export-oriented sectors of economy along with the multiplication of new business opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses through the purposeful development of local content, subsequent conversion and processing.

      In order for Kazakhstan to become one of the world`s 30 most developed countries, Kazakhstan has to considerably innovate in the manufacturing of raw materials. In the manufacturing industry, an important number of innovative new projects will be developed with the help of foreign companies including IVECO (Italy), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (Japan) and Byelkamit (Italy-U.S.). In addition, the advent of the Customs Union and the EEU has helped the economy increase its exports of processed artifacts; for example, the size of vehicle-related manufacturing increased 24-fold since 2010.

      SPAIID was launched in 672 facilities in the past five years, creating 69,000 jobs and contributing $17.4 billion in manufacturing and $724.4 million in exports. Many industrial businesses were created across the country during the first half of 2014 alone, manufacturing products such as power lines, drill PDC bits, chemicals, and cement.

      SPAIDD has increased Kazakhstan’s production capacities and profoundly contributed to economic growth and development. Moreover, the program has maintained a sustainable employment rate, which helped the country overcome the intentional financial crisis starting 2008.

  title: Nurly Zhol
  body: |
    First [President Nursultan Nazarbayev](http://kazakhstan-president.com/) in November 2014 announced a robust domestic stimulus policy titled ‘Nurly Zhol’ (Bright Path) that will drive state and foreign direct investment into critical infrastructure and priority sectors and drive economic growth. Nurly Zhol will total around $9 billion U.S. dollars and help to shift productivity towards agribusiness, manufacturing, trade and logistics, tourism, information technology and finance, and away from the oil sector. Importantly, Nurly Zhol will increase liquidity in the loans to small and medium sized business and domestic exporters. Nurly Zhol forecasts 4,500 new jobs by supporting SME growth.

    __Nurly Zhol targets seven areas of investment:__

    1. Development of transport and logistics infrastructure. Main road projects include those linking China to Western Europe, and Astana to Almaty. A logistics hub is being created in the east of the country, while marine infrastructure is being developed in the west.
    2. Development of industrial infrastructure. This includes the completion of infrastructure in existing special economic zones, and the construction of new industrial zones. The development of tourism infrastructure is expected to create many jobs.
    3. Development of energy infrastructure. The focus is on the construction of high-voltage lines spanning Ekibastuz, Semey and Ust-Kamenogorsk, and Semey to Aktogay, Taldykorgan and Almaty, with a view to ensuring a balanced energy supply.
    4. Modernization of public utilities infrastructure, and water and heat supply networks. In addition to the funds already budgeted for the modernization of heat and water supply systems, up to $540 million will be dedicated each year to accelerating the upgrades.
    5. Strengthening of housing infrastructure. Social housing will be constructed and made available for long-term rent with the right to buy. Low-interest loans and low mortgage interest will help make housing more affordable.
    6. Development of social infrastructure. An additional 20 billion tenge is being spent to reduce the deficit of kindergarten places. Ten higher-education institutions will also receive additional funding.
    7.  Support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and business activities. Loans totaling $837 million will help increase the output of the SME sector to 50 per cent of GDP by 2050.

    ### “KAZAKHSTAN-2050′′ STRATEGY: NEW POLITICAL COURSE OF THE ESTABLISHED STATE

    __The goal: preserving the nation’s high rate of economic growth.__

    In his [annual State-of-the-Nation address](http://strategy2050.kz/en/page/message_text2014/), President Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined a new strategy for Kazakhstan’s development through 2050, which is designed to serve as a coherent  continuation of the Kazakhstan-2030 Strategy.

    In his speech delivered on the eve of the country’s Independence Day, Nazarbayev announced  a series of milestone reforms in all spheres of the nation’s life. He laid out a strategy for the country, calling for better governance, improvement of the welfare and tax systems, support for small- and medium-sized businesses, and development of infrastructure.

    Currently ranked as the 51st most competitive country in the world, Kazakhstan, according to Nazarbayev, should be ranked among the 30 most advanced nations by 2050. To do so, Kazakhstan will need to integrate its economy into the global and regional environments by capitalizing on its transit potential and bolstering information technology capabilities.

    As an oil-rich country and a reliable international partner, Kazakhstan will lift the existing subsoil use moratorium in an effort to become “a regional magnet for investment.” This would be done in exchange for advanced technologies and the creation of new production.

    The President also tasked the government to increase the share of agriculture of the country’s GDP fivefold by 2050 through a series of measures including government stimulus packages. Nazarbayev asked the government to lift all licenses and permits not directly affecting safety in the first half of 2013. He also said it was necessary to redistribute responsibilities so a second wave of privatization of non-strategic enterprises can begin.

    The State Program for Accelerated Industrial Innovative Development (SPAIID)is a short-term plan announced in 2010 to apply through 2014. Developed at the encouragement of President Nazarbayev in his 2010 State of the Nation Address, the program focuses on industrial and infrastructure development while also boosting diversification through small- to medium-sized businesses. 

    The program reveals the country’s strategy for diversification and involves the key approaches laid out in the Strategy of Industrial and Innovation Development for 2003-2015, and of the program “30 Corporate Leaders of Kazakhstan,” as well as other policy documents in the field of industrialization.

    For the period until 2015, the main priority of for industrialization will be the implementation of major investment projects in the traditional export-oriented sectors of economy along with the multiplication of new business opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses through the purposeful development of local content, subsequent conversion and processing.

    In order for Kazakhstan to become one of the world`s 30 most developed countries, Kazakhstan has to considerably innovate in the manufacturing of raw materials. In the manufacturing industry, an important number of innovative new projects will be developed with the help of foreign companies including IVECO (Italy), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (Japan) and Byelkamit (Italy-U.S.). In addition, the advent of the Customs Union and the EEU has helped the economy increase its exports of processed artifacts; for example, the size of vehicle-related manufacturing increased 24-fold since 2010.

    SPAIID was launched in 672 facilities in the past five years, creating 69,000 jobs and contributing $17.4 billion in manufacturing and $724.4 million in exports. Many industrial businesses were created across the country during the first half of 2014 alone, manufacturing products such as power lines, drill PDC bits, chemicals, and cement.

    SPAIDD has increased Kazakhstan’s production capacities and profoundly contributed to economic growth and development. Moreover, the program has maintained a sustainable employment rate, which helped the country overcome the intentional financial crisis starting 2008.

  title: Gender Equality
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan strongly supports equal opportunities for women and considers gender equality not only a human right, but also an economic right. Women now contribute 40 percent of Kazakhstan’s GDP, and account for 52 percent of those engaged in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Women also make up 66 percent of individual entrepreneurs. 

    The 2011 Enterprise Survey’s country note on Kazakhstan says women were owners or part-owners of 34.4 percent of the country’s businesses and 28 percent of manufacturing companies held women ownership.  The [UNDP Country Programme Document for 2016-2020](http://www.kz.undp.org/content/kazakhstan/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/02/20/undp-hosts-consultations-with-government-on-2016-2020-country-programme-document-.html), a document drafted in partnership with the Government of Kazakhstan and the National Commission for Women Affairs, Family and Demographic Policy, focuses on more targeted support to women entrepreneurs, and to women who are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  

    __March 8 International Women's Day is a National Holiday in Kazakhstan__

    Kazakhstan is ranked #56 in the [United Nations Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/KAZ) and is #43 (out of 142 countries) in gender equality by the World Economic Forum 2014.

    20 percent of Kazakhstan's parliamentary ministers are women. In the 2015 ranking compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Kazakhstan ranks 47th (on a par with France) by percentage of women in national parliaments. Just for the sake of comparison, the United States comes at 76th, after Kenya and Saudi Arabia.

    Almost 34 percent of Kazakhstan's foreign service officers are women and 21 of them occupy senior executive diplomatic positions. [Akmaral Arystanbekova](https://www.kazakhembus.com/content/kazakhstan%E2%80%99s-first-un-representative-reflects-24-years-membership) served as Kazakhstan's first permanent representative to the United Nations from 1992-1999 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1989-1991.

      __Important milestones in the history of Kazakhstan__

      Kazakhstan has a long and fascinating history, going back thousands of years. Some remnants are still visible today such as Great Silk Road monuments, petroglyphs and sometimes even mysterious archaeological sites[^4]. The Amazons might have originated from Kazakhstan, the first steppe nomads are supposed to have emerged from here and it is very likely that Genghis Khan was buried in Eastern Kazakhstan.[^2] In recent times more and more details about Kazakh history and culture have been re-discovered, making the country also more and more interesting for domestic and international culture seekers.

      The territory of Kazakhstan came to be mastered by man nearly a million years ago[^3]. As early as the age of the Lower Paleolithic, ancient man settled down on these Karatau lands fit for normal life, rich with game and wild fruit. It is here that they have found ancient settlements from the Stone Age. By and by, in the centuries of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, man came to master Central and Eastern Kazakhstan and the Mangyshlak area.

      As has been shown by excavations of the Neolithic settlement Botay in Northern Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan constitutes a region of [horse domestication](/about-kazakhstan/culture/horse-culture) (breeding) and that of the formation of nomadic civilizations. Archeologists have revealed dwellings and numerous hand-made articles of stone and ivory which present the ancient history and archeology of Kazakhstan in the Stone age in an altogether new way.

      As early as the Bronze Age, some four millennia ago, the territory of Kazakhstan was inhabited by tribes of the so-called Andron and Begazy-Dandybay culture. They were engaged in farming and cattle-breeding, and were fine warriors who handled combat chariots marvelously. To this day we can see images of chariots drawn on rocks where ancient people would arrange their tribal temples and sanctuaries with the firmament as their natural cover. On the surfaces of black cliffs burnt with the sun people would chisel out scenes of dances, images of sun-headed deities, mighty camels and bulls as impersonations of ancient gods.

      Burial mounds of noble warriors scattered all throughout Kazakh steppes are known for the magnificent size both of the mounds and burial vaults proper. Particularly famous are such necropolis in the steppes of Sary-Arka and Tagiskent in the Trans-Aral area. People of that epoch were not only fine warriors, shepherds and farmers but also skilled metallurgists. They would take bronze and manufacture axes, knives, daggers and various decorations thereof.

      It was they who initiated the development of copper which is being practiced to this day - they are the Zhezkazgan and Sayak copper mines of today. Ancient people lived in large settlements and ancient towns surrounded with walls and towers.

      These towns were inhabited by warriors and craftsmen, priests and farmers. These tribes lived on the territory of Kazakhstan for about a thousand years - from the 17th century B.C. to 9th-8th centuries A.D.

      Later on they were ousted by the Saks. Such was the name given to this tribe by ancient Persians. The Chinese called them "se" whereas Greeks chose to call them Scythians. They were essentially nomads, semi-nomads and farmers. Yet, first and foremost, they were excellent horsemen. In fact, Saks were the first ever horsemen in the world to master arrow-shooting at full speed.
      In the 5th-2nd centuries B.C., the Saks set up their first state with its center in the Zhetysu(Semirechje) in South-Eastern Kazakhstan. The kings of the Saks were at the same time high priests. Saks had a written language and a mythology of their own; they were known for their well developed art of world standard labeled in research papers as "animal-styled art". Respective subjects were represented by predators and herbivorous animals and the struggle there between. Sheer masterpieces made of gold and bronze serve as worthy exhibits in the best museums of the world. The linguistic situation was just as complicated. As is traditionally believed, in the course of the first millennium B.C., the population of Kazakhstan was mostly represented by native speakers of Indo-European and Indo-Iranian languages. However, of late, they are inclined to think that the tribes of the Bronze Age, particularly those of the Saks, included tribes that spoke proto-Turkic languages.

      In the Issyk burial mound which harbored the world-famous "Golden Man" they have found a silver bowl whose bottom bore an inscription consisting 26 characters. They have failed to read it to this day. Some think that the inscription is made in one of the Iranian languages, others insist on its proto-Turkic origin. In any case, this must be the very period that highlighted the formation of the state of mind and the language of medieval and modern Kazakhs, their physiological stereotypes, in fact, of many an element of their culture, everyday life and folk rites.
      The middle of the first millennium A.D. is a fairly important stage in the history of all Turks in general and Kazakhs in particular. The period is marked with manifest changes in ethnic media: predominant now become Turkic tribes which chose the Altai as their natural center. Written sources of the 6thcentury register the term "Tyurk" which is pronounced as "Tutszyue" by the Chinese and as "Turk" by the Sogdians.

      Archeological studies of Turkic monuments make it possible to somehow compare "these" Turks with certain Turkic tribal associations. In the Sayano-Altai region they have identified certain archeological cultures which might well be likened to early Kyrgyz, early Kypchaks or early Oguzes. In the course of not infrequent internecine wars, tribal discord, and struggles for power and pasture, a part of the Turkic tribes which inhabited the steppes and valleys of Kazakhstan moved southwards - to Central Asia (say, Tyurgeshes, Karluks, Kypchaks, Uzbeks, Oguz, and Turkmens-Seldzhuks), to Asia Minor, to the Caucasus (Turkmen and Seldzhuks), and to Eastern Europe (Kangars and Pechenegs, Kypchaks-and-Polovtsians, Torks-and-Oguz, black Klobuks and Karakalpakians).

      Starting from the 4th century up to the beginning of the 13th century, the territory of Kazakhstan was the seat of West-Turkic, Tyurgesh, Karluk Kaganates, of the state made by the Oguz, Karakhanides, Kimeks and Kypchaks. All of them successively replaced one another right up to the Mongol invasion. After the invasion, i.e. in the beginning of the 13th century, uluses of the Mongol Empire of Zhuchi-Khan and Zhagatai were formed, which later gave birth to Ak-Orda, Mongolistan and finally to the Kazakh Khanate.
      Essentially all these states were mixed economies. Tribes of cattle-breeders had farming tribes as their neighbors, and steppes and cities supplemented each other. Such cities as Taraz, Otrar, Ispijab, and Talkhir were set up right in the middle of the Great Silk Road, which served as a reliable link joining antiquity and the Middle Ages, the West and the East: Japan, Korea and China with Central Asia, Iran, the State of the Seldzhuks, Rus, Byzantium, France and Italy.

      It is through the Great Silk Road that dancing arts, painting, architecture and music made their way from one people to another. Incidentally, it was the way along which various religions advanced: Manichaeism and Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, with the latter becoming predominant (starting from the 8th century) and subsequently the solitary faith of the Kazakhs. In the late 14th-early 15th century, on the banks of the Syrdaria River in the city of Turkestan, they erected a religious sacred place worshipped by all Turkic-speaking nations - the complex of Khodja Akhmed Yasavi.

      The nation that inhabited the territory of Kazakhstan would avidly absorb and assimilate all the ideas and achievements of various civilizations, making - in its turn - its own contribution to the treasury of world culture, be it economy or handicraft or music: among numerous accomplishments one may name the mobile dwelling "yurta", saddles and stirrups for horses, combat arts on horse-back, carpet ornaments and silver jewelry, sweet melodies and music reminding one of the impetuous gallop of steppe horses...
      All these factors have determined the integrity and continuity of the ancient and medieval history of Kazakhstan.

        ### Why Celebrate 550 Years of Kazakh Statehood?

        Words, particularly names, can have a great power. Astana means “capital” in Kazakh. The name was suggested by President Nursultan Nazarbayev and has now become one of the brands strongly associated with the Republic of Kazakhstan.

        But what about “Kazakhstan” itself? There was a discussion a year ago about the President’s proposal to consider renaming the country “Kazakh Yeli”. The great monument on Independence Square in Astana actually bears that name. And “Kazakh Yeli” actually means “the land of Kazakhs” or “Kazakhland”. Just as Deutschland, Poland, Finland and Thailand is a simple description of who, mostly, lives in each country. In fact, “Kazakhstan” has exactly the same meaning as “Kazakh Yeli”, but in Persian (with “stan” meaning land). So where did this name of the sovereign state, which has been a member of the United Nations for the last 23 years, come from?

        History textbooks tell us that the first use of the word “Kazakh” dates back to the late 13th century. It is considered to be of Turkic origin and means “a free man”, i.e. “someone who left his tribe or clan to live a life of an adventurer.” Many scholars believe that Russian word for “Kazak” meaning “Cossack” most likely originated from the same word.

        When back in 1459 several clans followed Sultans Kerey and Zhanibek in defiance of Khan Abulkhair Sheibanid, the powerful ruler of “nomadic Uzbeks”, and migrated out of their native land to the valleys of rivers Shu and Talas, they were called “Kazakhs”, in the pejorative meaning of being“outsiders”. The union of tribes led by Kerey and Zhanibek quickly grew in numbers and strength throughout 1460s and 1470s, “Kazakh” gradually became a name associated with the people behind the new military force and, subsequently, the name of the state that developed from it.

        The key source on Kazakh khanate’s early history – Mirza Mukhammad Khaidar Douglat’s study “Tarih-i-Rashidi”, written between 1541 and 1546, labelled the new state “doulat-i kazak” (the Kazakh state). For a few decades in the late 15th century and the first decade of the 16th century, the heirs of Abulkhair Khan Sheibanid, or Uzbeks as they were known then, challenged the legitimacy of the Kazakh rulers’ claim to the title of khan. Unsuccessful in these efforts,  they instead conquered the fertile lands between the Central Asia’s two largest rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya, known frrom the earliest times to the Iranians as “the lands beyond the river (Amu Dariya)” or Maverannakhr in the Arabic language. Having settled there, the Sheibanids dropped their ambition to “punish” their “rebellious” cousins. From around  1510, and well into the mid-19th century, the territory  to the north of the agricultural lands of Syr Dariya valley, were ruled by those who claimed the title of “khan” and lineage from Kerey and Zhanibek, and thus from Genghis Khan.

        That those rulers were recognized as “legitimate” holders of the title is confirmed by the Russian colonial administration’s acceptance of  the practice, long after most Kazakh clans and their leaders came under the Tsar’s protectorate in  mid-18th century, and well into the first quarter of 19th century (the reforms of 1822-1824 cancelled the administrative references to Kazakh Khans, although in 1841-1847 the rebellious sultan Kenessary Kassymuly was recognised by most Kazakhs as their Khan).

        It was around 1562 when the Kazakh khanate first became known in Western Europe. It appeared as “Cassackia” on a map drawn by Anthony Jenkinson, an English diplomat and traveller, to fill in the area between “Tashkent” and “Siberia”. Even if Jenkinson never visited this part of the Great Steppe, he was likely to learn about the Kazakh khanate from the Russians, as he was the English Crown’s first ambassador to Moscow during the time of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.

        A state of nomadic people has notable differences from that of a people with settled populations inhabiting towns and villages. Because of the nature of their economy, the nomads did not have much access to writing materials to document their everyday lives. This, of course, hampered the development of a proper tax system to fund the functioning of the administration. It also explains why there are fewer historical sources shedding light on the developments in nomadic states like the Kazakh khanate. However, a rich oral tradition flourished and the Kazakh language now has few regional differences, despite more than 3,000 kilometres of distance separating western and eastern Kazakhs and more than 1,500 kilometres those living in northern and southern parts.

        There was also less division of labour in nomadic societies. Because nomads do not live in settlements, there were no schools with specialised education. Enforcement of court decisions was problematic and was often based on voluntary acceptance of the punishment since there were no prisons and plenty of space into which to escape. Nor did a permanent army exist. The reality was leaders had little difficulty in quickly assembling a capable military force in case of a conflict or a war.

        These factors naturally proved to be historical weaknesses that eventually led to the end of nomadic states between 17th and 19th centuries. The settled populations were more advanced and more powerful.  But this does not deny the nomadic political entities their status as states.

        In the case of Kazakhs, between 1465 and 1822, there was a distinct population of “Kazakhs”, whose rulers held the titles of “khans.” They were recognised descendants of the history’s most powerful conqueror, Genghis Khan, with legitimacy to rule. This history shows the statehood of the “Kazakh people”.

        Today most members of the United Nations are nation-states. The issue of “nation” is a more complicated and nuanced than a “state”. It will most likely remain a subject of heated academic debate for the foreseeable future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised. Kazakhstan, as most other political entities in the world, positions itself as a “nation-state.” The preamble of its Constitution begins with the statement, “We, the people of Kazakhstan, united by a common historic fate, [are] creating a state on the indigenous Kazakh land.” So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the entire population, which has lived through historic experiences that have united “the people of Kazakhstan”. The clear reference to the “indigenous” Kazakh land links the modern state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

        According to Ernest Gellner, the definition of nationalism is “primarily a political principle, which holds that political and national unit should be congruent.” Gellner relied on German sociologist Max Weber’s definition of state, i.e. “political unit”, as an agency which has a monopoly of ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have a political unit of “The Republic of Kazakhstan”, what is a “national unit”? It is clear that the initial national unit that created the very idea of Kazakhstan were the ethnic Kazakhs.

        There is an argument, though not particularly mainstream, that the political unit of Kazakhstan is not congruent with the national one. It claims that Kazakhstan’s contemporary borders are artificial and were simply drawn up by Bolsheviks, while the nation of “Kazakhs” was artificially modelled on Stalin’s imagination of “national policies”. But it is hard to see what the evidence to support this view is.

        It is true, of course, that many modern nations in Asia and Africa bear traces of purposeful modelling along the lines drawn from the 19th century European and American experiences of nation-building. But a nation is rarely sustainable without some “ethnic” origins – a bond through people who have inhabited the particular territory for generations and feel connected to the land.  Otherwise, the attempt to create a nation-state is most likely to fail.

        This bond is what helps define the modern nation of Kazakhstan. It was “modelled” to reflect the living historical bond with the Kazakh people and their heritage. Borders of the nation with this name took shape mainly in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created. The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions came after protracted debates involving the representatives of local communists. These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)” movement, which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial autonomy for Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

        The borders they proposed were based on the most relevant demographic and statistical data of the time, such as the census of the Russian Empire’s population in 1897. According to this census, speakers of “Kirgiz-Kaisak”, –  the Kazakh language – numbered more than 4 million people at the time and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial” borders of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s politically stable development must be due to this congruence between the “national” and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the early 1920s.

        The 20th century, however, has turned Kazakhstan into a multiethnic, multicultural society that it is today. A major change in the country’s demographic structure was shaped by several waves of mainly voluntary, economically motivated migrations of Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians) and some Turkic groups (Tatars, Uighur, Uzbeks), along with the Stalin era’s involuntary resettlements of Germans, Poles, Koreans, Chechens, and other Caucasian peoples.

        Kazakhstan’s good fortune is that, despite these shake-ups, these diverse groups have lived in harmony with each other. The country has experienced no major conflict along ethnic or religious lines. Moreover, the hardships of forced collectivisation, being part of the Soviet Union’s grand war effort against Nazi Germany, post-war reconstruction, and then the break-up of the USSR and the difficult adaptation to a free market economy that followed,  all brought the people of different ethnicities closer together, strengthening tolerance and the need for mutual understanding and solidarity. These challenges have helped unite them into a single group – “the people of Kazakhstan”. Whether you call it a “Kazakh nation”, in line with international thesaurus, is a matter of a secondary importance.

        Then why at all celebrate the Kazakh khanate’s anniversary? For the same reason people mark anniversaries of a major past event all around the world. It is an opportunity to remind ourselves of our background,  reflect on the journey of our culture and strengthen the understanding of who we are. The celebration of 550 years of the Kazakh khanate will help further unite all of us who chose to live in the land of the Kazakhs as one “people of Kazakhstan” and will strengthen our links with this land.

              a people with settled populations inhabiting towns and villages. Because
              of the nature of their economy, the nomads did not have much access
              to writing materials to document their everyday lives. This, of course,
              hampered the development of a proper tax system to fund the functioning
              of the administration. It also explains why there are fewer historical
              sources shedding light on the developments in nomadic states like the
              Kazakh khanate. However, a rich oral tradition flourished and the Kazakh
              language now has few regional differences, despite more than 3,000 kilometres
              of distance separating western and eastern Kazakhs and more than 1,500
              kilometres those living in northern and southern parts.

              foreseeable future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised.
              Kazakhstan, as most other political entities in the world, positions
              itself as a “nation-state.” The preamble of its Constitution begins
              with the statement, “We, the people of Kazakhstan, united by a common
              historic fate, [are] creating a state on the indigenous Kazakh land.”
              So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the entire population, which has
              lived through historic experiences that have united “the people of Kazakhstan”.
              The clear reference to the “indigenous” Kazakh land links the modern
              state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

              monopoly of ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have

              shape mainly in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic
              was created. The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions
              came after protracted debates involving the representatives of local
              communists. These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)”
              movement, which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial
              autonomy for Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

              time and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial”
              borders of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s
              politically stable development must be due to this congruence between
              the “national” and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the
              early 1920s.

               reflect on the journey of our culture and strengthen the understanding
              of who we are. The celebration of 550 years of the Kazakh khanate will
              help further unite all of us who chose to live in the land of the Kazakhs
              as one “people of Kazakhstan” and will strengthen our links with this
              land.

    title: Travel & Tourism
    body: |-
      __Tourism in Kazakhstan - The Land of Wonders__

      Kazakhstan is a unique region in the world, because of its history, geographical position and size. Being the world’s 9th largest country and located in the centre of Eurasia, it is also the largest landlocked country in the world. These resulted in a specific climate and a peculiar natural system of the country, which seems to absorb the brightest examples of landscape of both continents. In addition, complicated history of Kazakh people and constant interaction of nomadic lifestyle with settled people in South Kazakhstani ancient cities, have lead to a unique and authentic culture of Kazakhstan.

      These peculiarities have created an opportunity to develop various and diverse offers for travel and tourism in Kazakhstan, which include authentic cultural tourism,nature-based activities, including ecotourism, birdwatching, etc. in national parks and protected areas, skiing or trekking in mountains, water sports, sunbathing andswimming in lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan, and many others. 

      __Nature-based tourism__

      Diversity of natural areas has contributed to rich flora and fauna of Kazakhstan. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 species of birds and 107 species of fish; and over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves were established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.

      The most famous of them among tourists include Aksu Zhabagly Nature Reserve, which is a habitat of snow leopard and other rare animals, and is also known as a Kingdom of Tulips, where tulips are believed to originate, long before they were introduced in Holland; Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve is famous for its pink flamingos and other rare species of wildlife, and popular among bird-watchers; Altyn Emel National Park is interesting for its mystery of Singing Dune; Katon-Karagay National Park is a habitat of marals (red deers), unossified antlers of which are used as a precious medicine. 

      __Mountains: Trekking and winter sports__

      A range of high, middle and low mountains, such as Tien Shan, Altay, Ulytau, Kazygurt, etc. have a beautiful nature attracting tourists from all over the world. Tien Shan Mountains is the highest among them (with the highest peak of about 7000 metres), and Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, is located at its bottom. Thus, an easy access to marvelous landscapes for tourists interested in trekking and winter sports is available from Almaty city.

      Most popular climbing routes are located in the Small Almaty Valley and Bogdanovich Glacier. Attractions of these places include Pogrebetsky Glacier (4,231 meters), Tuyuc Su (4100 m), Ordzhonikidze (3980 m) peaks, and many others. In addition, high mountains of Kazakhstan are ideal for winter sports. There is no wonder that Kazakhstan hosted Winter Asian Games in 2011: one of the priorities of the country has been propaganda of winter sports.

      A unique sport complex Medeu (sometimes spelled as Medew or Medeo), with a skating rink popular among tourists, was built in 1950’s, at 1691 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest skating rink in the world. A sophisticated artificial refrigeration system enables to keep high quality ice coverage over 8-months of the year. Another major winter sport attraction of Kazakhstan is Shymbulak (Chimbulak) ski resort, also located not far from Almaty. Snow lies in these places from November till May; however, sunny weather is usually registered there during more than three hundred days each year. The resort hotel can accept up to 114 tourists. 

      __Lakes and rivers: water sports, sunbathing and health resorts__

      Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.
      Coast of the biggest lake in the world – Caspian Sea is perfect for sunbathing, swimming and fishing. The largest number of reservoirs is concentrated in the south-east part of the country, in the region with a symbolic name Zhetysu - “Seven Rivers”. Almost all the rivers of Zhetysu belong to the basin of Lake Balkhash, which is also a popular tourist destination for its health centres and recreation camps. Besides health resorts, rafting in mountain rivers for extreme tourists, boating and sailing in lakes are only a few examples of activities offered for tourists in Kazakhstan.

      __Culture: ethnotourism__

      Unique culture of Kazakhstan is a reason to travel to Kazakhstan for many tourists. Almost in every corner of the republic, a visitor, interested in real life of Kazakh people - their traditions, rituals, art and culture, will find many things of interest. These include museum complexes, ethno villages, depicting traditional lifestyle of Kazakh people, historical sites of medieval cities and many others.

      For example, tourists are offered to experience traditional lifestyle of Kazakhs, to try national dishes and to interact with the local people in Shabanbay Bi Village, situated in Kyzylaray Mountains, Central Kazakhstan. Zhambyl Zhabayev museum complex in Almaty region includes a house with a garden, where the poet lived in XIX-XX centuries and a mausoleum. This is a visual representation of not only Zhambyl’s life, but also of a whole era in which the poet lived and worked. South Kazakhstan is famous for ancient cities located at the routes of the Great Silk Road with historical monuments and other sites.

      Ethno-memorial complex Map of Kazakhstan - Atameken, located in Astana, is the largest ethnographic park in Kazakhstan and a unique outdoor museum. Cities and landscapes of the country, as well as mini copies of main attractions and historical sites can be found on the map.

            Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.

      title: Nur-Sultan
      body: "Nur-Sultan is located in the center of Kazakhstan in the dry steppe zone
        and in the grass steppe subzone. The area of the city stands above the flood
        plain. The Yessil River is a major waterway of the capital. The city has an
        extreme continental climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan
        hosted the 2017 world's fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana Expo
        2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s favourable location in the centre
        of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically advantageous transport,
        communication and logistics centre, and a natural bridge between Europe and
        Asia.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yrqt_3Po2LE\"
        frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
        picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe transfer of the capital
        to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
        high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
        in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for
        10 percent, while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2 percent.\n\nThe
        city has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan. \n\nEntrepreneurship
        is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are more than 128,000 small
        and medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan is among the leading cities
        of the country in terms of the volume of construction. After the city became
        the capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres of housing facilities
        have been built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan and abroad took part
        in the construction of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural concept of Nur-Sultan
        was based on the idea of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying a special Eurasian
        style of Nur-Sultan should harmoniously combine the cultural traditions of
        both the East and the West. A well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa
        became the author of the general layout of the capital city.\n\nToday Nur-Sultan,
        located in the heart of Eurasia, is a venue for numerous international forums,
        congresses and large scale international events. The Congress of Leaders of
        World and Traditional Religions, the Astana Economic Forum and other forums
        are held regularly in the city. In December, 2010, the historical Summit of
        the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe took place in the
        capital city of Kazakhstan, after which it hosted the anniversary summits
        of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
        In early 2011, the city welcomed the participants and guests of the 7th Asian
        Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted the international specialized exhibition
        EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military district was founded in 1832 on
        the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods. Until 1961, the name
        of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and because of its ideal location,
        it soon turned into a central point for trade livestock fairs. In 1961, the
        name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola in 1992. Astana was not the
        official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital was renamed to Nur-Sultan after
        the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n### Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n-
        In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s area was over 300 sq. km., but today, the city boundaries
        are rapidly expanding.\n- The distance between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the
        former capital, is 1,318 km.\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s population was about
        300,000. This year (2009), the population has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn
        1997, the President of Kazakhstan made the decision to relocate the capital
        of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Akmola city (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n-
        Advantageous geopolitical location\n- Considerable industrial potential\n-
        Crucial resources for subsequent development of the construction industry\n-
        Location in the largest transport junction\n- Essential transport and telecommunication
        infrastructure\n- Highly skilled urban workforce\n- Large private sector\n-
        Potentialities for entrepreneurship development\n- Political and social stability\n-
        Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe most important reason for
        moving the capital and expanding and improving the city of Nur-Sultan was
        to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically stable and prosperous, democratically
        viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt Nur-Sultan’s historical
        inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From now on any major decisions
        important for the future of the people will be made here in the centre of
        this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland is beating here. Kazakhstan
        is making and defining its history and destiny here and today.”\n\nIn 1998,
        the decision was made to officially change the name of the new capital Akmola
        to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year later, the Astana from waterUnited
        Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) granted
        the status, “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe city’s rapid growth as the
        administrative and business center of the country matches the original concept
        for social and economic development. The theme of this concept is “The blossoming
        of Astana is the blossoming of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More than 200 joint ventures
        and foreign companies are operating in the capital, including those belonging
        to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Kyrgyzstan\n- Switzerland.\n \nAstana
        is a member of the International Association of Capitals and Cultural Cities
        of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); it also has close bilateral
        relations with 13 cities and regions of the CIS.\n\n__The growth of Astana,
        as a result of it becoming the new capital, has had a powerful influence on
        neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n- Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n- East
        Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also supported the development of entrepreneurship
        and businesses which will, in turn, lead to the opening of foreign companies,
        firms, and major bank branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business Magnet__\n\nAstana
        is a major center of activity and the hub of national and international transport
        links. The extensive traffic is mainly due to strong economic ties between:\n\n-
        South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The
        Volga region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government
        have spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and 2004,
        the number of new legal entities registered in the capital more than doubled,
        and the local housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers of the
        capital city’s economic activity are:__\n\n- Construction\n- The food industry\n-
        Tourism\n\nThe city boasts a growing number of restaurants and hotels that
        cater to business travelers. Major exhibition centers and universities, such
        as the L. Gumilyov Eurasian University, can be found within Astana. The A.
        Barayev Research Institute of Grain Farming is another establishment, not
        only famous in Kazakhstan but within the scientific world. In addition to
        the three museums, Astana also has branches of the Union of Writers and Artists
        of Kazakhstan, with over 40 newspapers and two literary magazines being published
        in the city.\n\n__Tourist Attractions__\n\n__Astana’s tourist attractions

        with a sweeping view of the city\n- A circus\n- An ethnic park\n- A presidential
        culture museum\n- The world’s most inland aquarium\n- A 10,000-seat skating
        stadium and cycle track.\n\nAdditionally, Astana is fast becoming a mecca
        for sports tourism; new sport centers are planned for the neighboring areas
        of Korgalzhyn and Ereimentau.\n\n__Culture and the Arts__\n\nThe Presidential
        Cultural Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established in the center
        of Astana. The structure of the Center includes a museum Cultural Centerwith
        various rooms and displays representing Kazakhstan’s past and present values.
        In addition, the Center has a library containing more than a million books
        and electronic catalogues.\n\nThe Kazakh National Music Academy has also been
        established in Astana. This Academy combines specialized and general musical
        education into one school. The Academy is a member of the European Association
        of Conservatories, Academies and Musical High Schools.\n\n__Spectators enjoy
        visiting theaters such as:__\n\n- The Theater of Drama and Music, named after
        K. Kuanyshbaev and opened on November 15, 1991\n- The State Theater of Russian

        after K Baiseitova and opened in Cinema City2000.\n\nIn addition to theaters,
        the pristine new cinema complex, Cinema-City, was opened in 2000. It was built
        in the tradition of international cinemas and has become a favorite of the
        people of Astana.\n\n__Eighth Wonder of the World__\n\nIn September 2006,
        the inauguration of the Palace of Peace and Accord (62 meters in height),
        also known as the Peace Pyramid, marked another milestone in Astana’s evolution
        and may well become the Eighth Wonder of the World. Built to house the Assembly
        of Nations of Kazakhstan, a university, a museum, a library and a winter garden,
        the pyramid was designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster, who is famous
        for his futuristic glass roof on the German Parliament, the Reichstag.\n\n__Special
        Economic Zone__\n\nConstruction of the new city developments on left bank
        of the Esil River has started. To aid in this process, the Special Economic
        Zone (SEZ), providing more favorable conditions for investment, has been created.
        According to the General Development Plan of the Capital, the integrated structure
        of this complex, located on the left bank, will symbolize the new capital.\n\n__The

        in the juridical regime of the SEZ or its liquidation before the appointed
        time, including the extension of the area. \n\nThe Customs regulation in the
        territory of the SEZ is applied in accordance to the customs legislature of
        Republic of Kazakhstan. The territory of the SEZ is considered to be a part

            value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its
              territory is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape
              is far from uniform, as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains,
              and river valleys. In the North is found the Kokshetau summit; in the
              southern and south-eastern portions of the region is the Saryarka, part
              of the Kazakh topography; and plains compose the North-East.

        To promote tourism, Kazakhstan enforced a “Law on Tourism” (1992) that embraces virtually all types of tourism. __The law also addresses key issues of tourism activities:__

        - Legal
        - Economic
        - Social
        - Organizational

        In addition to this law, the Government has adopted several enactments concerning tourism concerns, including a number of documents that regulate the licensing of tourism activities. In 1993, the National Program for developing Kazakhstan’s tourism industry was adopted, and in 1997, the Government passed the State Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, designed to accomplish the following goals:

        - Regenerate historic centers of the Great Silk Route
        - Preserve and development the cultural legacy of Turkic-speaking states
        - Create the tourism infrastructure from 1997-2003.

        Additionally, Kazakhstan became a member of the World Tourism Organization in 1993.
        The Committee for Regulation of Trade and Tourist Activity, a branch of the Ministry for Industry and Trade, is the body that manages tourism in Kazakhstan. Certain executive departments and tourism representatives from other countries carry out the administration of this committee.

        In 1997, Kazakhstan created the Strategy of tourism development, intended to be intact through 2030. Today, 430 tourism agencies, firms, and bureaus of various property forms function effectively in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They employ nearly 6,000 people and 1,500 professional guides. Kazakhstan tourism firms cooperate with almost 80 countries of the world; approximately 25 tourism firms in Almaty and five in regional centers arrange charter flights to the following countries:

        - India
        - Turkey
        - The United Arab Emirates
        - Pakistan
        - South Korea
        - Greece
        - Poland.

        There are also cooperative agreements with the following places:

        - Turkey
        - Iran,
        - The Xinjang Uigur Autonomous Area of China
        - Moldova
        - Hungary
        - The State of Israel
        - Kyrghyzstan
        - Egypt

        In addition to those already in place, Kazakhstan is in the process of making intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements with other nations, including:

        - Croatia
        - Pakistan
        - Singapore

        Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in United Kingdom tourists over the past few years, and with the recent visa simplification procedures (letters of invitation are no longer required of EU and US citizens) still greater numbers are expected.

    title: Democracy
    body: "Kazakhstan is a constitutional republic and is a fledging democracy after
      a long period of being a republic of the former Soviet Union.  According to
      Kazakhstan’s constitution, Kazakhstan's democracy is secular and values individual
      “life, rights, and freedoms.” Kazakhstan’s Constitution also establishes key
      democratic principles of the separation of powers, equality and the institution
      of elections in Kazakhstan.\n\nSince independence, the Kazakh people have steadily
      built the values of Kazakhstan's democracy. Kazakhstan improved its positioning
      in international ratings. For example, in the Corruption Perception Index prepared
      by Transparency International Kazakhstan has shown continued rank improvement
      year over year. \n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img
      src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/img/kz/osce-alignment.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n\nSince
      its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan's democracy has consistently
      become more stable. [The transition to democracy](http://kznewsline.com/tag/kazakhstan-democracy/)
      in Kazakhstanresulted in the establishment of a Secular Constitution in 1995.
      Constitution, modeled after Western models of the separation of powers, outlines
      the responsibilities of the executive, legislative and judicial branches.  The
      executive power is under the President, the Government and the Ministries. The
      Senate and the Mazhilis control legislative powers. Lastly, the Constitutional
      Council and the Supreme Court control judicial power.\n\nThe first presidential
      elections in Kazakhstan were held in January 1999 with the election of former
      Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh (SSR) Nursultan Nazarbayev, who
      was subsequently re-elected in 2006 and in 2011 to serve for five-years, pursuant
      to a 2007 constitutional amendment that shortened the Presidential term by two
      years. This new amendment also reinforced the Parliament`s authority.  In early
      2009, a law was adopted on political groups that ensures the presence of at
      least two parties in Parliament. In January 2012, parliamentary elections were
      held using a closed, party-list system. President Nazarbayev’s party Nur Otan
      garnered 80.99% of the vote, followed by the Ak Jol party (7.47%) and the Communist
      People's Party of Kazakhstan (KNPK) (7.19%). The four opposition parties all
      received less than the required 7% minimum to qualify for representation in
      Parliament.\n\nThe Kazakh people on June 9, 2019 [elected](https://astanatimes.com/2019/06/tokayev-wins-kazakhstans-presidency-with-70-76-percent-of-vote-official-preliminary-results-say/)
      Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with 70.76% of the popular vote. Tokayev was one of [seven
      candidates](https://astanatimes.com/2019/05/seven-candidates-compete-for-countrys-highest-office-in-june-9-election/)
      running in the election. \n "

            to enhance the teaching of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
            by providing schools with a 21st century learning environment. To do that,
            education officials have assembled a team of the world’s top suppliers
            of innovative education products, including members of the UK consortium
            TVET UK and the California-based firm Pasco Scientific. In the less than
            five years since its launch, PILTI has facilitated the installation of
            new STEM and language teaching technologies in more than 20,000 classrooms
            across the country. More than 40,000 Kazakh teachers have been trained
            to use these new tools and incorporate them into a pedagogical method
            that emphasizes student participation, rather than lecturing.

      title: Bolashak Scholarship
      body: |-
        In 1993, Kazakhstan was the first Central Asian country to launch a presidential scholarship program, ‘Bolashak’, for international study. ‘Bolashak’, which means ‘future’ in Kazakh, speaks to the importance Kazakhstan puts on educating its youth at the best universities in the world. The Bolashak Programme is an all-expenses paid scholarship sponsored by awarded to high-performing students from Kazakhstan for graduate study at an overseas university. Upon completion of their graduate degree, Bolashak scholars are required to return to work in Kazakhstan for at least five years. The program is designed to train future leaders in business, international relations, law, science, engineering and other key fields.

        Since its implementation in 1993, more than 6,500 students have been awarded the scholarship, with most choosing to study in the United States and Great Britain.They have successfully graduated from America’s leading universities including Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Emory, Carnegie Mellon, Indiana University, Vanderbilt and many others.

      __Kazakh Literature__

      Kazakh literature is the literature created in the modern state of Kazakhstan, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, the Kazakh part of the Russian Empire, and the Kazakh Khanate. There is some overlap with several complementary themes, including the literature of Turkic tribes that inhabited Kazakhstan over the course of the history and literature written by ethnic Kazakhs.

      __Medieval Literature__

      According to Chinese written sources of 6th-8th centuries CE, Turkic tribes of Kazakhstan had oral poetry tradition. Traces of this tradition are shown on stone carvings dated 5th-7th centuries C.E. that describes rule of Kultegin and Bilge, two early Turkic rulers ("kagans").

      Book of Dede Korkut and Oguz Name (a story of ancient Turkic king Oghuz Khan) are the most well-known Turkic heroic legends. Initially created around 9th century CE, they were passed over the generations in oral form these legends were recorded by Turkish authors in 14-16th centuries C.E.

      __Abay Kunanbayev__

      The preemininent role in the development of modern literary Kazakh belongs to Abay Qunanbayuli (or Kunanbayev, Kazakh: Абай Құнанбайұлы) (1845–1904), whose writings did much to preserve Kazakh folk culture. Abay's major work is The Book of Words (Kazakh: қара сөздері, Qara sözderi), a philosophical treatise and collection of poems where he criticizes Russian colonial policies and encourages other Kazakhs to embrace education and literacy.

    title: Kazakhstan from Space
    body: |-
      Commander Scott Kelly of the International Space Station has amazed the world with his photos of planet Earth taken from space. His photos show us howbreathtakingly surreal and beautiful Earth looks from orbit. These are the photos he's taken from above Kazakhstan. Update: Astronauts continue to take photos of Kazakhstan from ISS. Their photos will continue to be added at the end of this list.

    ### Why Celebrate 550 Years of Kazakh Statehood?

    Words, particularly names, can have a great power. Astana means “capital” in Kazakh. The name was suggested by President Nursultan Nazarbayev and has now become one of the brands strongly associated with the Republic of Kazakhstan.

    But what about “Kazakhstan” itself? There was a discussion a year ago about the President’s proposal to consider renaming the country “Kazakh Yeli”. The great monument on Independence Square in Astana actually bears that name. And “Kazakh Yeli” actually means “the land of Kazakhs” or “Kazakhland”. Just as Deutschland, Poland, Finland and Thailand is a simple description of who, mostly, lives in each country. In fact, “Kazakhstan” has exactly the same meaning as “Kazakh Yeli”, but in Persian (with “stan” meaning land). So where did this name of the sovereign state, which has been a member of the United Nations for the last 23 years, come from?

    History textbooks tell us that the first use of the word “Kazakh” dates back to the late 13th century. It is considered to be of Turkic origin and means “a free man”, i.e. “someone who left his tribe or clan to live a life of an adventurer.” Many scholars believe that Russian word for “Kazak” meaning “Cossack” most likely originated from the same word.

    When back in 1459 several clans followed Sultans Kerey and Zhanibek in defiance of Khan Abulkhair Sheibanid, the powerful ruler of “nomadic Uzbeks”, and migrated out of their native land to the valleys of rivers Shu and Talas, they were called “Kazakhs”, in the pejorative meaning of being“outsiders”. The union of tribes led by Kerey and Zhanibek quickly grew in numbers and strength throughout 1460s and 1470s, “Kazakh” gradually became a name associated with the people behind the new military force and, subsequently, the name of the state that developed from it.

    The key source on Kazakh khanate’s early history – Mirza Mukhammad Khaidar Douglat’s study “Tarih-i-Rashidi”, written between 1541 and 1546, labelled the new state “doulat-i kazak” (the Kazakh state). For a few decades in the late 15th century and the first decade of the 16th century, the heirs of Abulkhair Khan Sheibanid, or Uzbeks as they were known then, challenged the legitimacy of the Kazakh rulers’ claim to the title of khan. Unsuccessful in these efforts,  they instead conquered the fertile lands between the Central Asia’s two largest rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya, known frrom the earliest times to the Iranians as “the lands beyond the river (Amu Dariya)” or Maverannakhr in the Arabic language. Having settled there, the Sheibanids dropped their ambition to “punish” their “rebellious” cousins. From around  1510, and well into the mid-19th century, the territory  to the north of the agricultural lands of Syr Dariya valley, were ruled by those who claimed the title of “khan” and lineage from Kerey and Zhanibek, and thus from Genghis Khan.

    That those rulers were recognized as “legitimate” holders of the title is confirmed by the Russian colonial administration’s acceptance of  the practice, long after most Kazakh clans and their leaders came under the Tsar’s protectorate in  mid-18th century, and well into the first quarter of 19th century (the reforms of 1822-1824 cancelled the administrative references to Kazakh Khans, although in 1841-1847 the rebellious sultan Kenessary Kassymuly was recognised by most Kazakhs as their Khan).

    It was around 1562 when the Kazakh khanate first became known in Western Europe. It appeared as “Cassackia” on a map drawn by Anthony Jenkinson, an English diplomat and traveller, to fill in the area between “Tashkent” and “Siberia”. Even if Jenkinson never visited this part of the Great Steppe, he was likely to learn about the Kazakh khanate from the Russians, as he was the English Crown’s first ambassador to Moscow during the time of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.

    A state of nomadic people has notable differences from that of a people with settled populations inhabiting towns and villages. Because of the nature of their economy, the nomads did not have much access to writing materials to document their everyday lives. This, of course, hampered the development of a proper tax system to fund the functioning of the administration. It also explains why there are fewer historical sources shedding light on the developments in nomadic states like the Kazakh khanate. However, a rich oral tradition flourished and the Kazakh language now has few regional differences, despite more than 3,000 kilometres of distance separating western and eastern Kazakhs and more than 1,500 kilometres those living in northern and southern parts.

    There was also less division of labour in nomadic societies. Because nomads do not live in settlements, there were no schools with specialised education. Enforcement of court decisions was problematic and was often based on voluntary acceptance of the punishment since there were no prisons and plenty of space into which to escape. Nor did a permanent army exist. The reality was leaders had little difficulty in quickly assembling a capable military force in case of a conflict or a war.

    These factors naturally proved to be historical weaknesses that eventually led to the end of nomadic states between 17th and 19th centuries. The settled populations were more advanced and more powerful.  But this does not deny the nomadic political entities their status as states.

    In the case of Kazakhs, between 1465 and 1822, there was a distinct population of “Kazakhs”, whose rulers held the titles of “khans.” They were recognised descendants of the history’s most powerful conqueror, Genghis Khan, with legitimacy to rule. This history shows the statehood of the “Kazakh people”.

    Today most members of the United Nations are nation-states. The issue of “nation” is a more complicated and nuanced than a “state”. It will most likely remain a subject of heated academic debate for the foreseeable future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised. Kazakhstan, as most other political entities in the world, positions itself as a “nation-state.” The preamble of its Constitution begins with the statement, “We, the people of Kazakhstan, united by a common historic fate, [are] creating a state on the indigenous Kazakh land.” So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the entire population, which has lived through historic experiences that have united “the people of Kazakhstan”. The clear reference to the “indigenous” Kazakh land links the modern state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

    According to Ernest Gellner, the definition of nationalism is “primarily a political principle, which holds that political and national unit should be congruent.” Gellner relied on German sociologist Max Weber’s definition of state, i.e. “political unit”, as an agency which has a monopoly of ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have a political unit of “The Republic of Kazakhstan”, what is a “national unit”? It is clear that the initial national unit that created the very idea of Kazakhstan were the ethnic Kazakhs.

    There is an argument, though not particularly mainstream, that the political unit of Kazakhstan is not congruent with the national one. It claims that Kazakhstan’s contemporary borders are artificial and were simply drawn up by Bolsheviks, while the nation of “Kazakhs” was artificially modelled on Stalin’s imagination of “national policies”. But it is hard to see what the evidence to support this view is.

    It is true, of course, that many modern nations in Asia and Africa bear traces of purposeful modelling along the lines drawn from the 19th century European and American experiences of nation-building. But a nation is rarely sustainable without some “ethnic” origins – a bond through people who have inhabited the particular territory for generations and feel connected to the land.  Otherwise, the attempt to create a nation-state is most likely to fail.

    This bond is what helps define the modern nation of Kazakhstan. It was “modelled” to reflect the living historical bond with the Kazakh people and their heritage. Borders of the nation with this name took shape mainly in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created. The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions came after protracted debates involving the representatives of local communists. These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)” movement, which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial autonomy for Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

    The borders they proposed were based on the most relevant demographic and statistical data of the time, such as the census of the Russian Empire’s population in 1897. According to this census, speakers of “Kirgiz-Kaisak”, –  the Kazakh language – numbered more than 4 million people at the time and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial” borders of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s politically stable development must be due to this congruence between the “national” and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the early 1920s.

    The 20th century, however, has turned Kazakhstan into a multiethnic, multicultural society that it is today. A major change in the country’s demographic structure was shaped by several waves of mainly voluntary, economically motivated migrations of Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians) and some Turkic groups (Tatars, Uighur, Uzbeks), along with the Stalin era’s involuntary resettlements of Germans, Poles, Koreans, Chechens, and other Caucasian peoples.

    Kazakhstan’s good fortune is that, despite these shake-ups, these diverse groups have lived in harmony with each other. The country has experienced no major conflict along ethnic or religious lines. Moreover, the hardships of forced collectivisation, being part of the Soviet Union’s grand war effort against Nazi Germany, post-war reconstruction, and then the break-up of the USSR and the difficult adaptation to a free market economy that followed,  all brought the people of different ethnicities closer together, strengthening tolerance and the need for mutual understanding and solidarity. These challenges have helped unite them into a single group – “the people of Kazakhstan”. Whether you call it a “Kazakh nation”, in line with international thesaurus, is a matter of a secondary importance.

    Then why at all celebrate the Kazakh khanate’s anniversary? For the same reason people mark anniversaries of a major past event all around the world. It is an opportunity to remind ourselves of our background,  reflect on the journey of our culture and strengthen the understanding of who we are. The celebration of 550 years of the Kazakh khanate will help further unite all of us who chose to live in the land of the Kazakhs as one “people of Kazakhstan” and will strengthen our links with this land.

          of the 16th century, the heirs of Abulkhair Khan Sheibanid, or Uzbeks as
          they were known then, challenged the legitimacy of the Kazakh rulers’ claim

          the fertile lands between the Central Asia’s two largest rivers Syr Darya
          and Amu Darya, known frrom the earliest times to the Iranians as “the lands
          beyond the river (Amu Dariya)” or Maverannakhr in the Arabic language. Having

          cousins. From around  1510, and well into the mid-19th century, the territory

          with settled populations inhabiting towns and villages. Because of the nature
          of their economy, the nomads did not have much access to writing materials
          to document their everyday lives. This, of course, hampered the development
          of a proper tax system to fund the functioning of the administration. It
          also explains why there are fewer historical sources shedding light on the
          developments in nomadic states like the Kazakh khanate. However, a rich
          oral tradition flourished and the Kazakh language now has few regional differences,
          despite more than 3,000 kilometres of distance separating western and eastern
          Kazakhs and more than 1,500 kilometres those living in northern and southern

          and plenty of space into which to escape. Nor did a permanent army exist.

    __Important milestones in the history of Kazakhstan__

    Kazakhstan has a long and fascinating history, going back thousands of years. Some remnants are still visible today such as Great Silk Road monuments, petroglyphs and sometimes even mysterious archaeological sites[^4]. The Amazons might have originated from Kazakhstan, the first steppe nomads are supposed to have emerged from here and it is very likely that Genghis Khan was buried in Eastern Kazakhstan.[^2] In recent times more and more details about Kazakh history and culture have been re-discovered, making the country also more and more interesting for domestic and international culture seekers.

    The territory of Kazakhstan came to be mastered by man nearly a million years ago[^3]. As early as the age of the Lower Paleolithic, ancient man settled down on these Karatau lands fit for normal life, rich with game and wild fruit. It is here that they have found ancient settlements from the Stone Age. By and by, in the centuries of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, man came to master Central and Eastern Kazakhstan and the Mangyshlak area.

    As has been shown by excavations of the Neolithic settlement Botay in Northern Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan constitutes a region of [horse domestication](/about-kazakhstan/culture/horse-culture) (breeding) and that of the formation of nomadic civilizations. Archeologists have revealed dwellings and numerous hand-made articles of stone and ivory which present the ancient history and archeology of Kazakhstan in the Stone age in an altogether new way.

    As early as the Bronze Age, some four millennia ago, the territory of Kazakhstan was inhabited by tribes of the so-called Andron and Begazy-Dandybay culture. They were engaged in farming and cattle-breeding, and were fine warriors who handled combat chariots marvelously. To this day we can see images of chariots drawn on rocks where ancient people would arrange their tribal temples and sanctuaries with the firmament as their natural cover. On the surfaces of black cliffs burnt with the sun people would chisel out scenes of dances, images of sun-headed deities, mighty camels and bulls as impersonations of ancient gods.

    Burial mounds of noble warriors scattered all throughout Kazakh steppes are known for the magnificent size both of the mounds and burial vaults proper. Particularly famous are such necropolis in the steppes of Sary-Arka and Tagiskent in the Trans-Aral area. People of that epoch were not only fine warriors, shepherds and farmers but also skilled metallurgists. They would take bronze and manufacture axes, knives, daggers and various decorations thereof.

    It was they who initiated the development of copper which is being practiced to this day - they are the Zhezkazgan and Sayak copper mines of today. Ancient people lived in large settlements and ancient towns surrounded with walls and towers.

    These towns were inhabited by warriors and craftsmen, priests and farmers. These tribes lived on the territory of Kazakhstan for about a thousand years - from the 17th century B.C. to 9th-8th centuries A.D.

    Later on they were ousted by the Saks. Such was the name given to this tribe by ancient Persians. The Chinese called them "se" whereas Greeks chose to call them Scythians. They were essentially nomads, semi-nomads and farmers. Yet, first and foremost, they were excellent horsemen. In fact, Saks were the first ever horsemen in the world to master arrow-shooting at full speed.
    In the 5th-2nd centuries B.C., the Saks set up their first state with its center in the Zhetysu(Semirechje) in South-Eastern Kazakhstan. The kings of the Saks were at the same time high priests. Saks had a written language and a mythology of their own; they were known for their well developed art of world standard labeled in research papers as "animal-styled art". Respective subjects were represented by predators and herbivorous animals and the struggle there between. Sheer masterpieces made of gold and bronze serve as worthy exhibits in the best museums of the world. The linguistic situation was just as complicated. As is traditionally believed, in the course of the first millennium B.C., the population of Kazakhstan was mostly represented by native speakers of Indo-European and Indo-Iranian languages. However, of late, they are inclined to think that the tribes of the Bronze Age, particularly those of the Saks, included tribes that spoke proto-Turkic languages.

    In the Issyk burial mound which harbored the world-famous "Golden Man" they have found a silver bowl whose bottom bore an inscription consisting 26 characters. They have failed to read it to this day. Some think that the inscription is made in one of the Iranian languages, others insist on its proto-Turkic origin. In any case, this must be the very period that highlighted the formation of the state of mind and the language of medieval and modern Kazakhs, their physiological stereotypes, in fact, of many an element of their culture, everyday life and folk rites.
    The middle of the first millennium A.D. is a fairly important stage in the history of all Turks in general and Kazakhs in particular. The period is marked with manifest changes in ethnic media: predominant now become Turkic tribes which chose the Altai as their natural center. Written sources of the 6thcentury register the term "Tyurk" which is pronounced as "Tutszyue" by the Chinese and as "Turk" by the Sogdians.

    Archeological studies of Turkic monuments make it possible to somehow compare "these" Turks with certain Turkic tribal associations. In the Sayano-Altai region they have identified certain archeological cultures which might well be likened to early Kyrgyz, early Kypchaks or early Oguzes. In the course of not infrequent internecine wars, tribal discord, and struggles for power and pasture, a part of the Turkic tribes which inhabited the steppes and valleys of Kazakhstan moved southwards - to Central Asia (say, Tyurgeshes, Karluks, Kypchaks, Uzbeks, Oguz, and Turkmens-Seldzhuks), to Asia Minor, to the Caucasus (Turkmen and Seldzhuks), and to Eastern Europe (Kangars and Pechenegs, Kypchaks-and-Polovtsians, Torks-and-Oguz, black Klobuks and Karakalpakians).

    Starting from the 4th century up to the beginning of the 13th century, the territory of Kazakhstan was the seat of West-Turkic, Tyurgesh, Karluk Kaganates, of the state made by the Oguz, Karakhanides, Kimeks and Kypchaks. All of them successively replaced one another right up to the Mongol invasion. After the invasion, i.e. in the beginning of the 13th century, uluses of the Mongol Empire of Zhuchi-Khan and Zhagatai were formed, which later gave birth to Ak-Orda, Mongolistan and finally to the Kazakh Khanate.
    Essentially all these states were mixed economies. Tribes of cattle-breeders had farming tribes as their neighbors, and steppes and cities supplemented each other. Such cities as Taraz, Otrar, Ispijab, and Talkhir were set up right in the middle of the Great Silk Road, which served as a reliable link joining antiquity and the Middle Ages, the West and the East: Japan, Korea and China with Central Asia, Iran, the State of the Seldzhuks, Rus, Byzantium, France and Italy.

    It is through the Great Silk Road that dancing arts, painting, architecture and music made their way from one people to another. Incidentally, it was the way along which various religions advanced: Manichaeism and Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, with the latter becoming predominant (starting from the 8th century) and subsequently the solitary faith of the Kazakhs. In the late 14th-early 15th century, on the banks of the Syrdaria River in the city of Turkestan, they erected a religious sacred place worshipped by all Turkic-speaking nations - the complex of Khodja Akhmed Yasavi.

    The nation that inhabited the territory of Kazakhstan would avidly absorb and assimilate all the ideas and achievements of various civilizations, making - in its turn - its own contribution to the treasury of world culture, be it economy or handicraft or music: among numerous accomplishments one may name the mobile dwelling "yurta", saddles and stirrups for horses, combat arts on horse-back, carpet ornaments and silver jewelry, sweet melodies and music reminding one of the impetuous gallop of steppe horses...
    All these factors have determined the integrity and continuity of the ancient and medieval history of Kazakhstan.

      ### Why Celebrate 550 Years of Kazakh Statehood?

      Words, particularly names, can have a great power. Astana means “capital” in Kazakh. The name was suggested by President Nursultan Nazarbayev and has now become one of the brands strongly associated with the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      But what about “Kazakhstan” itself? There was a discussion a year ago about the President’s proposal to consider renaming the country “Kazakh Yeli”. The great monument on Independence Square in Astana actually bears that name. And “Kazakh Yeli” actually means “the land of Kazakhs” or “Kazakhland”. Just as Deutschland, Poland, Finland and Thailand is a simple description of who, mostly, lives in each country. In fact, “Kazakhstan” has exactly the same meaning as “Kazakh Yeli”, but in Persian (with “stan” meaning land). So where did this name of the sovereign state, which has been a member of the United Nations for the last 23 years, come from?

      History textbooks tell us that the first use of the word “Kazakh” dates back to the late 13th century. It is considered to be of Turkic origin and means “a free man”, i.e. “someone who left his tribe or clan to live a life of an adventurer.” Many scholars believe that Russian word for “Kazak” meaning “Cossack” most likely originated from the same word.

      When back in 1459 several clans followed Sultans Kerey and Zhanibek in defiance of Khan Abulkhair Sheibanid, the powerful ruler of “nomadic Uzbeks”, and migrated out of their native land to the valleys of rivers Shu and Talas, they were called “Kazakhs”, in the pejorative meaning of being“outsiders”. The union of tribes led by Kerey and Zhanibek quickly grew in numbers and strength throughout 1460s and 1470s, “Kazakh” gradually became a name associated with the people behind the new military force and, subsequently, the name of the state that developed from it.

      The key source on Kazakh khanate’s early history – Mirza Mukhammad Khaidar Douglat’s study “Tarih-i-Rashidi”, written between 1541 and 1546, labelled the new state “doulat-i kazak” (the Kazakh state). For a few decades in the late 15th century and the first decade of the 16th century, the heirs of Abulkhair Khan Sheibanid, or Uzbeks as they were known then, challenged the legitimacy of the Kazakh rulers’ claim to the title of khan. Unsuccessful in these efforts,  they instead conquered the fertile lands between the Central Asia’s two largest rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya, known frrom the earliest times to the Iranians as “the lands beyond the river (Amu Dariya)” or Maverannakhr in the Arabic language. Having settled there, the Sheibanids dropped their ambition to “punish” their “rebellious” cousins. From around  1510, and well into the mid-19th century, the territory  to the north of the agricultural lands of Syr Dariya valley, were ruled by those who claimed the title of “khan” and lineage from Kerey and Zhanibek, and thus from Genghis Khan.

      That those rulers were recognized as “legitimate” holders of the title is confirmed by the Russian colonial administration’s acceptance of  the practice, long after most Kazakh clans and their leaders came under the Tsar’s protectorate in  mid-18th century, and well into the first quarter of 19th century (the reforms of 1822-1824 cancelled the administrative references to Kazakh Khans, although in 1841-1847 the rebellious sultan Kenessary Kassymuly was recognised by most Kazakhs as their Khan).

      It was around 1562 when the Kazakh khanate first became known in Western Europe. It appeared as “Cassackia” on a map drawn by Anthony Jenkinson, an English diplomat and traveller, to fill in the area between “Tashkent” and “Siberia”. Even if Jenkinson never visited this part of the Great Steppe, he was likely to learn about the Kazakh khanate from the Russians, as he was the English Crown’s first ambassador to Moscow during the time of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.

      A state of nomadic people has notable differences from that of a people with settled populations inhabiting towns and villages. Because of the nature of their economy, the nomads did not have much access to writing materials to document their everyday lives. This, of course, hampered the development of a proper tax system to fund the functioning of the administration. It also explains why there are fewer historical sources shedding light on the developments in nomadic states like the Kazakh khanate. However, a rich oral tradition flourished and the Kazakh language now has few regional differences, despite more than 3,000 kilometres of distance separating western and eastern Kazakhs and more than 1,500 kilometres those living in northern and southern parts.

      There was also less division of labour in nomadic societies. Because nomads do not live in settlements, there were no schools with specialised education. Enforcement of court decisions was problematic and was often based on voluntary acceptance of the punishment since there were no prisons and plenty of space into which to escape. Nor did a permanent army exist. The reality was leaders had little difficulty in quickly assembling a capable military force in case of a conflict or a war.

      These factors naturally proved to be historical weaknesses that eventually led to the end of nomadic states between 17th and 19th centuries. The settled populations were more advanced and more powerful.  But this does not deny the nomadic political entities their status as states.

      In the case of Kazakhs, between 1465 and 1822, there was a distinct population of “Kazakhs”, whose rulers held the titles of “khans.” They were recognised descendants of the history’s most powerful conqueror, Genghis Khan, with legitimacy to rule. This history shows the statehood of the “Kazakh people”.

      Today most members of the United Nations are nation-states. The issue of “nation” is a more complicated and nuanced than a “state”. It will most likely remain a subject of heated academic debate for the foreseeable future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised. Kazakhstan, as most other political entities in the world, positions itself as a “nation-state.” The preamble of its Constitution begins with the statement, “We, the people of Kazakhstan, united by a common historic fate, [are] creating a state on the indigenous Kazakh land.” So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the entire population, which has lived through historic experiences that have united “the people of Kazakhstan”. The clear reference to the “indigenous” Kazakh land links the modern state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

      According to Ernest Gellner, the definition of nationalism is “primarily a political principle, which holds that political and national unit should be congruent.” Gellner relied on German sociologist Max Weber’s definition of state, i.e. “political unit”, as an agency which has a monopoly of ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have a political unit of “The Republic of Kazakhstan”, what is a “national unit”? It is clear that the initial national unit that created the very idea of Kazakhstan were the ethnic Kazakhs.

      There is an argument, though not particularly mainstream, that the political unit of Kazakhstan is not congruent with the national one. It claims that Kazakhstan’s contemporary borders are artificial and were simply drawn up by Bolsheviks, while the nation of “Kazakhs” was artificially modelled on Stalin’s imagination of “national policies”. But it is hard to see what the evidence to support this view is.

      It is true, of course, that many modern nations in Asia and Africa bear traces of purposeful modelling along the lines drawn from the 19th century European and American experiences of nation-building. But a nation is rarely sustainable without some “ethnic” origins – a bond through people who have inhabited the particular territory for generations and feel connected to the land.  Otherwise, the attempt to create a nation-state is most likely to fail.

      This bond is what helps define the modern nation of Kazakhstan. It was “modelled” to reflect the living historical bond with the Kazakh people and their heritage. Borders of the nation with this name took shape mainly in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created. The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions came after protracted debates involving the representatives of local communists. These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)” movement, which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial autonomy for Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

      The borders they proposed were based on the most relevant demographic and statistical data of the time, such as the census of the Russian Empire’s population in 1897. According to this census, speakers of “Kirgiz-Kaisak”, –  the Kazakh language – numbered more than 4 million people at the time and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial” borders of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s politically stable development must be due to this congruence between the “national” and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the early 1920s.

      The 20th century, however, has turned Kazakhstan into a multiethnic, multicultural society that it is today. A major change in the country’s demographic structure was shaped by several waves of mainly voluntary, economically motivated migrations of Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians) and some Turkic groups (Tatars, Uighur, Uzbeks), along with the Stalin era’s involuntary resettlements of Germans, Poles, Koreans, Chechens, and other Caucasian peoples.

      Kazakhstan’s good fortune is that, despite these shake-ups, these diverse groups have lived in harmony with each other. The country has experienced no major conflict along ethnic or religious lines. Moreover, the hardships of forced collectivisation, being part of the Soviet Union’s grand war effort against Nazi Germany, post-war reconstruction, and then the break-up of the USSR and the difficult adaptation to a free market economy that followed,  all brought the people of different ethnicities closer together, strengthening tolerance and the need for mutual understanding and solidarity. These challenges have helped unite them into a single group – “the people of Kazakhstan”. Whether you call it a “Kazakh nation”, in line with international thesaurus, is a matter of a secondary importance.

      Then why at all celebrate the Kazakh khanate’s anniversary? For the same reason people mark anniversaries of a major past event all around the world. It is an opportunity to remind ourselves of our background,  reflect on the journey of our culture and strengthen the understanding of who we are. The celebration of 550 years of the Kazakh khanate will help further unite all of us who chose to live in the land of the Kazakhs as one “people of Kazakhstan” and will strengthen our links with this land.

            population of “Kazakhs”, whose rulers held the titles of “khans.” They
            were recognised descendants of the history’s most powerful conqueror,
            Genghis Khan, with legitimacy to rule. This history shows the statehood
            of the “Kazakh people”.

          value: Today most members of the United Nations are nation-states. The issue
            of “nation” is a more complicated and nuanced than a “state”. It will
            most likely remain a subject of heated academic debate for the foreseeable
            future and, unfortunately, will continue to be politicised. Kazakhstan,
            as most other political entities in the world, positions itself as a “nation-state.”
            The preamble of its Constitution begins with the statement, “We, the people
            of Kazakhstan, united by a common historic fate, [are] creating a state
            on the indigenous Kazakh land.” So the nation of Kazakhstan includes the
            entire population, which has lived through historic experiences that have
            united “the people of Kazakhstan”. The clear reference to the “indigenous”
            Kazakh land links the modern state with its predecessor, the Kazakh khanate.

          value: According to Ernest Gellner, the definition of nationalism is “primarily
            a political principle, which holds that political and national unit should
            be congruent.” Gellner relied on German sociologist Max Weber’s definition
            of state, i.e. “political unit”, as an agency which has a monopoly of
            ‘legitimate violence’ in a certain territory”. If we have a political
            unit of “The Republic of Kazakhstan”, what is a “national unit”? It is
            clear that the initial national unit that created the very idea of Kazakhstan
            were the ethnic Kazakhs.

            claims that Kazakhstan’s contemporary borders are artificial and were
            simply drawn up by Bolsheviks, while the nation of “Kazakhs” was artificially
            modelled on Stalin’s imagination of “national policies”. But it is hard
            to see what the evidence to support this view is.

            bear traces of purposeful modelling along the lines drawn from the 19th
            century European and American experiences of nation-building. But a nation
            is rarely sustainable without some “ethnic” origins – a bond through people
            who have inhabited the particular territory for generations and feel connected
            to the land.  Otherwise, the attempt to create a nation-state is most
            likely to fail.

          value: This bond is what helps define the modern nation of Kazakhstan. It
            was “modelled” to reflect the living historical bond with the Kazakh people
            and their heritage. Borders of the nation with this name took shape mainly
            in 1920s when the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created.
            The borders may have been drawn in Moscow but the decisions came after
            protracted debates involving the representatives of local communists.
            These included former members of the Alash Orda “national(ist)” movement,
            which rallied in 1917-1919 for the creation of territorial autonomy for
            Kazakhs within a new democratic statehood of Russia.

          value: The borders they proposed were based on the most relevant demographic
            and statistical data of the time, such as the census of the Russian Empire’s
            population in 1897. According to this census, speakers of “Kirgiz-Kaisak”,
            –  the Kazakh language – numbered more than 4 million people at the time
            and constituted more than 80% of the areas within the “artificial” borders
            of contemporary Kazakhstan. So part of the reason for Kazakhstan’s politically
            stable development must be due to this congruence between the “national”
            and “political” units, created by the Soviets in the early 1920s.

          value: The 20th century, however, has turned Kazakhstan into a multiethnic,
            multicultural society that it is today. A major change in the country’s
            demographic structure was shaped by several waves of mainly voluntary,
            economically motivated migrations of Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians)
            and some Turkic groups (Tatars, Uighur, Uzbeks), along with the Stalin
            era’s involuntary resettlements of Germans, Poles, Koreans, Chechens,
            and other Caucasian peoples.

            diverse groups have lived in harmony with each other. The country has
            experienced no major conflict along ethnic or religious lines. Moreover,
            the hardships of forced collectivisation, being part of the Soviet Union’s
            grand war effort against Nazi Germany, post-war reconstruction, and then
            the break-up of the USSR and the difficult adaptation to a free market
            economy that followed,  all brought the people of different ethnicities
            closer together, strengthening tolerance and the need for mutual understanding
            and solidarity. These challenges have helped unite them into a single
            group – “the people of Kazakhstan”. Whether you call it a “Kazakh nation”,
            in line with international thesaurus, is a matter of a secondary importance.

             reflect on the journey of our culture and strengthen the understanding
            of who we are. The celebration of 550 years of the Kazakh khanate will
            help further unite all of us who chose to live in the land of the Kazakhs
            as one “people of Kazakhstan” and will strengthen our links with this
            land.

  title: Ethnic Groups
  body: |-
    The population of Kazakhstan is various by its ethnical compound. Representatives of 130 nationalities live here. The local ethnos – Kazakhs make the largest part of the population – 58.9%, while Russian – 25.9%, Ukrainians – 2.9%, Uzbeks – 2,8%, Uighur, Tatar and German - 1.5% each, and other groups 4,3%. There are more than 100 ethnic groups living in peace in Kazakhstan.

    Many nationalities have come to Kazakhstan not on their own will, but were driven here by political repression and persecution. In Stalin’s times Kazakhstan hosted 1.5 million of political prisoners from Russia and other regions of the USSR. And more than 1.3 million of people were deported by Stalin regime during World War II years “as representatives of unreliable nations”. All these people found understanding and support of Kazakh people, found their second Motherland on the land of Kazakhstan.

    The principle of equality of all ethnic groups that inhabit our country is strictly adhered by. All conditions for a full national self-expression have been created as well as the rights for the fulfilment of their ethno cultural interests are ensured. Legal guarantees and respectful treatment of all the languages used in the republic defend the integral right of citizens of any nationality to develop their language and culture. Figures witness the balance and harmony of the national policy: about 40% of secondary schools use Russian language in teaching. The higher education for 70% is available in Russian language. In areas of residence of compact ethnic groups schools function with Uyghur, Tajik, Ukrainian, German, Polish and other languages of teaching.

    The Sunday schools of national and cultural unions also receive support in the teaching of native languages. Today 30 languages of ethnic groups of Kazakhstan are taught in about 200 Sunday schools and 3 schools of national revival. Magazines and newspapers are published, TV and radio programs are broadcast in 11 national language in Kazakhstan. Books in the languages of ethnic minorities of Kazakhstan are published annually on the state order with a total number exceeding 80 000. Besides Kazakh and Russian theatres there are also Uyghur, German and Korean ones.

    Ethnic cultural centres have been established in all areas of Kazakhstan, to support ethnic identity of different nationalities. Their highest forum is the Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. Today this powerful social force has become an organic part of the civil society and expresses its views in the chambers of the Parliament, political parties, mass-media, state and non-government organizations. The Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan has become an important element of the political system of Kazakhstan. It has forged the interests of all the ethnos and ensures the rights and freedoms of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion. 27 republican and regional, more than 300 district ethnic cultural unions enter the Assembly of people of Kazakhstan. Three centres have an international status. The Assembly deals with 16 Small Regional Assemblies of peoples of Kazakhstan which act as consultative bodies by the regional administrations and comprise representatives of local ethnic-cultural and social unions.

    Kazakhstan’s efforts to ensure inter-ethnic peace and accord are essential for internal stability and are widely recognized in the world. The Pope as well as UN General Secretary Koffi Annan who paid visits to our country over the last five years cited Kazakhstan as the example of inter-ethnic consent and sustainable development of a multi-ethnic society. The interethnic policy is based on the principle of unity in variety. The civil peace and consent in Kazakhstan are the result of a persistent policy of the Government which enjoys the support of the whole society.

  title: Holidays
  body: "### January 1-2 – New Year\n\n### March 8 – International Women’s Day\n\nIWD
    is a global day celebrating the economic, political and social achievements of
    women past, present, and future.\n\n### March 22 – Nauryz (Traditional holiday
    of Spring, ancient Turkic New Year)\n\n“Nauruz”, Persian for “New Year”, is a
    time for family and friends to celebrate, cherish the past memories, and anticipate
    a better year. To rejoice in the end of the harsh winter and welcome the spring,
    relatives gather around a table and exchange gifts. All who join in the festivities,
    however, must have accomplished the following goals:\n\n- Asked for forgiveness
    of their sins\n- Liquidated their debts\n- Revived themselves spiritually\n- Physically
    reconciled with relatives and friends.\n\nSimilar to the Persian New Year, the
    number ‘7’ is significant for Kazakhs. For instance, the main ritual dish, “Nauryz-kozheh,”
    includes seven ingredients:\n\n- Water\n- Meat\n- Salt\n- Fat\n- Flour\n- Cereal\n-
    Milk\n\nThese seven ingredients signify the seven life beginnings:\n\n- Joy\n-
    Luck\n- Wisdom\n- Health\n- Wealth\n- Speedy growth\n- Heavenly protection\n\nEveryone
    must visit seven houses and invite seven guests.\n\nDuring the day, Kazakhs shout,
    “Koktem tudy!” (Spring is born!) in the streets, squares, parks and stadiums.
    There are plenty of activities to participate in or observe, including:\n\n- Horse-racing\n-
    Kazakhsha-kyres (national sport in which men wrestle while riding a horse)\n-
    Kokpar (team contest of rider groups trying to seize and take possession of a
    slaughtered goat’s body)\n- Ethnic theater\n- Fashion shows\n- Parades (marches
    that teach visitors about the Kazakh culture and the importance of respecting
    other countries).\n- Nauryz concert 2011\n\n### May 1 – Unity Day\n\nThis day
    marks the anniversary of the meeting held in 1726 between three local Kazak elders
    (biis), Tole Bi, Kazybek Bi, and Aiteke Bi. Fearing the threat of invading Dzhungars,
    the three sought to reunite their hordes to create a stronger, more effective
    defense. President Nazarbayev has indicated that the success of these men in uniting
    the Kyrgyz and Uzbek tribes should inspire the process of establishing peace in
    Central Asia.\n\nIn today’s world, Unity day is celebrated as a form of Labor
    Day: a day of national, regional, and global solidarity. Within the borders of
    Kazakhstan, many associations, unions, and communities of ethnic groups exist
    peacefully, including but not limited to Poles, Romanians, Hungarians, Greeks.\n\n###
    May 9 – Victory Day\n\nCelebrated since 1947, Victory Day marks the surrender
    of Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union in World War II. It was first inaugurated
    in the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union, following the signing of the surrender
    document on May 9, 1945.\n\n### July 6 - Astana Day\n\nOn July 6 Kazakhs celebrate
    the \"birthday\" of their capital - Astana (Astana was renamed to Nur-Sultan in
    March 2019). \n\n### August 30 – Constitution Day\n\nConstitution Day is a public
    holiday honoring the day Kazakhstan signed and adopted their Constitution.\n\n###
    December 16 – Independence Day\n\nIn just a short span of time, Kazakhstan has
    managed to become a stable, powerful, and well-respected nation. In honor of the
    past 18 years of independence, celebrations will be held throughout the country,
    including concerts, conferences, exhibitions, and feasts."

          to create a stronger, more effective defense. President Nazarbayev has indicated
          that the success of these men in uniting the Kyrgyz and Uzbek tribes should
          inspire the process of establishing peace in Central Asia.

  title: National Unity Doctrine
  body: "On the eve of the Day of Unity of Kazakhstan People on May 1, 2010, the authorities
    and civil society groups achieved consensus on the final version of the National
    Unity Doctrine, a project initiated by [President Nazarbayev](http://kazcham.com/) in
    October 2008 at the 14th Session of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan and designed
    to reflect the common ideals consolidating all citizens of Kazakhstan into a single
    nation, regardless of one’s ethnic heritage, religion, or social class. The first
    draft, designed by the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan and published in news
    media in November 2009, created much public interest and encouraged a wide debate
    on the ways to enhance social cohesion in the country of more than 140 ethnicities
    and 40 religious denominations.\n\nA number of representatives of Kazakhstan’s
    strong-minded intellectuals, however, argued against some provision of the draft,
    claiming the document underestimated the role of the Kazakh language and ethnic
    culture in consolidating the nation. \n\nResponding to criticism, the government
    engaged in a direct dialog with those intellectuals to consider their proposals
    aimed at improving the initial draft. Later, some opposition parties and activists
    also put forward their suggestions for the concept of national policy. Thus, a
    working group on generalization of proposals and doctrine refinement was formed.
    After the final resolution of the Council of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan
    (APK), President Nursultan Nazarbayev has approved the Doctrine of National Unity.
    Deputy Chairman of the Assembly, Head of the working group on the doctrine refinement
    Yeraly Tugzhanov announced the news on April 29 press conference, presenting the
    doctrine in Astana. Some authors consider the doctrine to be one of the most successful
    projects accomplished as a joint effort of the civil society and authorities in
    Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Doctrine of National Unity, a blueprint for strengthening the
    inter-ethnic harmony of Kazakhstan for years to come in a country destined to
    maintain its multicultural character and consolidation around common values, has
    caused a significant debate, which ultimately made good for stimulating dialog
    between the government and civil society. The final text states the modern Kazakhstan
    is a logical continuation of a long tradition of statehood on this territory,
    which combines with a shared tragic and glorious history of all peoples living
    here and those who made the country their hone.\n\nThe strategic priority for
    the contemporary Kazakhstan is achieving a national unity is based upon acknowledging
    a common system of values and principles for all citizens of the country. The
    key ones are embodied is the three stated National Unity Principles: “One country,
    one destiny”, “Various origins, equal opportunities”, and “Development of a national
    spirit”. The first one refers to the conscious identification of every Kazakhstan
    citizen with the nation-state, one which is based upon embracing the idea of a
    common mission to create a better future for their children in this country. The
    second principle justifies the core value of a democratic society, i.e. equal
    opportunities to achieving a better life for each individual regardless of their
    heritage, religion, or social class. The last one considers the great role of
    the spiritual (cultural) component in shaping an inclusive national identity.
    This heavily centers on the idea of developing the Kazakh language as the priority
    for the national unity, with the strict provision of the legal right of all ethnic
    groups to safeguard and use their own languages.\n\nThe Doctrine provides that
    implementing its provisions aims at activating and mobilizing the country’s human
    and intellectual potential for the goals of a consistent development of Kazakhstan,
    improving life standards for each citizen, delivering the rights and freedoms
    guaranteed by the country’s Constitution. \n\n“Economic growth, social progress
    and democratic development for the country are only possible if accompanied by
    consolidation and maintaining the unity of our society”, the doctrine states in
    the conclusion.\n\nTalking about the final text of the Doctrine, many commentators
    called it a highly relevant and adequate document, capable of encouraging better
    management of the country’s diversity and developing a stronger national identification
    for all citizens of the country. “Some critics of the Doctrine claimed it was
    redundant as there is the Constitution to do the job. I have always supported,
    however, the need to develop such a document. Constitution is a Law, but Doctrine
    is a Spirit. We need a spiritual consolidation of people of Kazakhstan around
    the principles that we all share and understand,” a prominent intellectual and
    philologist Murat Auezov said.\n“The doctrine’s final version proved that we can
    reach agreements and understand each other. This wasn’t forced upon us, people
    discussed it and felt it through their hearts”, he said referring to the public
    debates around the draft.\n\n“The words we have written there we need to support
    with real deeds and political will. Only then will it be implemented and help
    consolidate the nation and people… The Doctrine is an example of document that
    came into existence thanks to mutual understanding. When we all gathered at the
    round table, people with absolutely different credentials, we all, nevertheless,
    believed we could understand each other. And that’s what happened,” said Aydos
    Sarim, a journalist and politician, one of the members of the joint working group
    responsible for the final version.\n\n“What we have achieved in maintaining interethnic
    friendship in Kazakhstan, we must fix through documents, provide a solid fundament
    for that. I believe we already have a spiritual unity in Kazakhstan. We shouldn’t,
    however, simply boast about our accomplishment. We must move further. And that
    is how we developed this doctrine,” Kazakh Senator Anatoliy Bashmakov stated.\n\n“Everyone
    needs to grow up, including myself. I feel discomfort that I don’t know the Kazakh
    language. I am confident that for non-Kazakhs learning the state language should
    be a criterion of being a cultured person. I understand Kazakh but I cannot speak.
    The Doctrine lets us all feel we can learn Kazakh, and I see that our youth, our
    children understands that,” the ethnically Russian lawmaker added.\n\nNow that
    the Doctrine is approved by the President, the Government has been tasked with
    adapting its provisions to the operating policy acts and other documents. “The
    Doctrine is not a declarative project, but has a real mechanism of implementation
    within the existing programs of the republic’s ministries and state agencies”,
    Yeraly Tugzhanov noted."

          underestimated the role of the Kazakh language and ethnic culture in consolidating
          the nation. Responding to criticism, the government engaged in a direct
          dialog with those intellectuals to consider their proposals aimed at improving
          the initial draft. Later, some opposition parties and activists also put
          forward their suggestions for the concept of national policy. Thus, a working
          group on generalization of proposals and doctrine refinement was formed.

  title: Travel & Tourism
  body: |-
    __Tourism in Kazakhstan - The Land of Wonders__

    Kazakhstan is a unique region in the world, because of its history, geographical position and size. Being the world’s 9th largest country and located in the centre of Eurasia, it is also the largest landlocked country in the world. These resulted in a specific climate and a peculiar natural system of the country, which seems to absorb the brightest examples of landscape of both continents. In addition, complicated history of Kazakh people and constant interaction of nomadic lifestyle with settled people in South Kazakhstani ancient cities, have lead to a unique and authentic culture of Kazakhstan.

    These peculiarities have created an opportunity to develop various and diverse offers for travel and tourism in Kazakhstan, which include authentic cultural tourism,nature-based activities, including ecotourism, birdwatching, etc. in national parks and protected areas, skiing or trekking in mountains, water sports, sunbathing andswimming in lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan, and many others. 

    __Nature-based tourism__

    Diversity of natural areas has contributed to rich flora and fauna of Kazakhstan. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 species of birds and 107 species of fish; and over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves were established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.

    The most famous of them among tourists include Aksu Zhabagly Nature Reserve, which is a habitat of snow leopard and other rare animals, and is also known as a Kingdom of Tulips, where tulips are believed to originate, long before they were introduced in Holland; Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve is famous for its pink flamingos and other rare species of wildlife, and popular among bird-watchers; Altyn Emel National Park is interesting for its mystery of Singing Dune; Katon-Karagay National Park is a habitat of marals (red deers), unossified antlers of which are used as a precious medicine. 

    __Mountains: Trekking and winter sports__

    A range of high, middle and low mountains, such as Tien Shan, Altay, Ulytau, Kazygurt, etc. have a beautiful nature attracting tourists from all over the world. Tien Shan Mountains is the highest among them (with the highest peak of about 7000 metres), and Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, is located at its bottom. Thus, an easy access to marvelous landscapes for tourists interested in trekking and winter sports is available from Almaty city.

    Most popular climbing routes are located in the Small Almaty Valley and Bogdanovich Glacier. Attractions of these places include Pogrebetsky Glacier (4,231 meters), Tuyuc Su (4100 m), Ordzhonikidze (3980 m) peaks, and many others. In addition, high mountains of Kazakhstan are ideal for winter sports. There is no wonder that Kazakhstan hosted Winter Asian Games in 2011: one of the priorities of the country has been propaganda of winter sports.

    A unique sport complex Medeu (sometimes spelled as Medew or Medeo), with a skating rink popular among tourists, was built in 1950’s, at 1691 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest skating rink in the world. A sophisticated artificial refrigeration system enables to keep high quality ice coverage over 8-months of the year. Another major winter sport attraction of Kazakhstan is Shymbulak (Chimbulak) ski resort, also located not far from Almaty. Snow lies in these places from November till May; however, sunny weather is usually registered there during more than three hundred days each year. The resort hotel can accept up to 114 tourists. 

    __Lakes and rivers: water sports, sunbathing and health resorts__

    Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.
    Coast of the biggest lake in the world – Caspian Sea is perfect for sunbathing, swimming and fishing. The largest number of reservoirs is concentrated in the south-east part of the country, in the region with a symbolic name Zhetysu - “Seven Rivers”. Almost all the rivers of Zhetysu belong to the basin of Lake Balkhash, which is also a popular tourist destination for its health centres and recreation camps. Besides health resorts, rafting in mountain rivers for extreme tourists, boating and sailing in lakes are only a few examples of activities offered for tourists in Kazakhstan.

    __Culture: ethnotourism__

    Unique culture of Kazakhstan is a reason to travel to Kazakhstan for many tourists. Almost in every corner of the republic, a visitor, interested in real life of Kazakh people - their traditions, rituals, art and culture, will find many things of interest. These include museum complexes, ethno villages, depicting traditional lifestyle of Kazakh people, historical sites of medieval cities and many others.

    For example, tourists are offered to experience traditional lifestyle of Kazakhs, to try national dishes and to interact with the local people in Shabanbay Bi Village, situated in Kyzylaray Mountains, Central Kazakhstan. Zhambyl Zhabayev museum complex in Almaty region includes a house with a garden, where the poet lived in XIX-XX centuries and a mausoleum. This is a visual representation of not only Zhambyl’s life, but also of a whole era in which the poet lived and worked.

          ancient cities, have lead to a unique and authentic culture of Kazakhstan.

          Diversity of natural areas has contributed to rich flora and fauna of Kazakhstan. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 species of birds and 107 species of fish; and over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves were established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.

    title: Nur-Sultan
    body: "Nur-Sultan is located in the center of Kazakhstan in the dry steppe zone
      and in the grass steppe subzone. The area of the city stands above the flood
      plain. The Yessil River is a major waterway of the capital. The city has an
      extreme continental climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan
      hosted the 2017 world's fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana Expo
      2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s favourable location in the centre
      of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically advantageous transport, communication
      and logistics centre, and a natural bridge between Europe and Asia.\n\n<iframe
      width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yrqt_3Po2LE\"
      frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
      picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe transfer of the capital
      to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
      high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
      in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for 10
      percent, while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2 percent.\n\nThe
      city has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan. \n\nEntrepreneurship
      is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are more than 128,000 small
      and medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan is among the leading cities
      of the country in terms of the volume of construction. After the city became
      the capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres of housing facilities have
      been built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan and abroad took part in the
      construction of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural concept of Nur-Sultan was based
      on the idea of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying a special Eurasian style of Nur-Sultan
      should harmoniously combine the cultural traditions of both the East and the
      West. A well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa became the author of the
      general layout of the capital city.\n\nToday Nur-Sultan, located in the heart
      of Eurasia, is a venue for numerous international forums, congresses and large
      scale international events. The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional
      Religions, the Astana Economic Forum and other forums are held regularly in
      the city. In December, 2010, the historical Summit of the Organisation for Security
      and Co-operation in Europe took place in the capital city of Kazakhstan, after
      which it hosted the anniversary summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
      and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. In early 2011, the city welcomed the
      participants and guests of the 7th Asian Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted
      the international specialized exhibition EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military
      district was founded in 1832 on the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel
      woods. Until 1961, the name of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and
      because of its ideal location, it soon turned into a central point for trade
      livestock fairs. In 1961, the name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola
      in 1992. Astana was not the official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital was
      renamed to Nur-Sultan after the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n###
      Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s area was over 300
      sq. km., but today, the city boundaries are rapidly expanding.\n- The distance
      between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the former capital, is 1,318 km.\n- In 1998,
      Nur-Sultan’s population was about 300,000. This year (2009), the population
      has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn 1997, the President of Kazakhstan made
      the decision to relocate the capital of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Akmola city
      (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n- Advantageous geopolitical location\n-
      Considerable industrial potential\n- Crucial resources for subsequent development
      of the construction industry\n- Location in the largest transport junction\n-
      Essential transport and telecommunication infrastructure\n- Highly skilled urban
      workforce\n- Large private sector\n- Potentialities for entrepreneurship development\n-
      Political and social stability\n- Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe
      most important reason for moving the capital and expanding and improving the
      city of Nur-Sultan was to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically
      stable and prosperous, democratically viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt
      Nur-Sultan’s historical inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From
      now on any major decisions important for the future of the people will be made
      here in the centre of this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland
      is beating here. Kazakhstan is making and defining its history and destiny here
      and today.”\n\nIn 1998, the decision was made to officially change the name
      of the new capital Akmola to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year later, the
      Astana from waterUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
      (UNESCO) granted the status, “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe city’s rapid
      growth as the administrative and business center of the country matches the
      original concept for social and economic development. The theme of this concept
      is “The blossoming of Astana is the blossoming of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More than
      200 joint ventures and foreign companies are operating in the capital, including
      those belonging to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Kyrgyzstan\n- Switzerland.\n \nAstana
      is a member of the International Association of Capitals and Cultural Cities
      of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); it also has close bilateral
      relations with 13 cities and regions of the CIS.\n\n__The growth of Astana,
      as a result of it becoming the new capital, has had a powerful influence on
      neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n- Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n- East
      Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also supported the development of entrepreneurship
      and businesses which will, in turn, lead to the opening of foreign companies,
      firms, and major bank branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business Magnet__\n\nAstana
      is a major center of activity and the hub of national and international transport
      links. The extensive traffic is mainly due to strong economic ties between:\n\n-
      South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The Volga
      region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government have
      spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and 2004, the
      number of new legal entities registered in the capital more than doubled, and
      the local housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers of the capital
      city’s economic activity are:__\n\n- Construction\n- The food industry\n- Tourism\n\nThe
      city boasts a growing number of restaurants and hotels that cater to business
      travelers. Major exhibition centers and universities, such as the L. Gumilyov
      Eurasian University, can be found within Astana. The A. Barayev Research Institute
      of Grain Farming is another establishment, not only famous in Kazakhstan but
      within the scientific world. In addition to the three museums, Astana also has
      branches of the Union of Writers and Artists of Kazakhstan, with over 40 newspapers

          value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its territory
            is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape is far from
            uniform, as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains, and river valleys.
            In the North is found the Kokshetau summit; in the southern and south-eastern
            portions of the region is the Saryarka, part of the Kazakh topography;
            and plains compose the North-East.

    title: National Initiatives
    body: |-
      To promote tourism, Kazakhstan enforced a “Law on Tourism” (1992) that embraces virtually all types of tourism. __The law also addresses key issues of tourism activities:__

      - Legal
      - Economic
      - Social
      - Organizational

      In addition to this law, the Government has adopted several enactments concerning tourism concerns, including a number of documents that regulate the licensing of tourism activities. In 1993, the National Program for developing Kazakhstan’s tourism industry was adopted, and in 1997, the Government passed the State Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, designed to accomplish the following goals:

      - Regenerate historic centers of the Great Silk Route
      - Preserve and development the cultural legacy of Turkic-speaking states
      - Create the tourism infrastructure from 1997-2003.

      Additionally, Kazakhstan became a member of the World Tourism Organization in 1993.
      The Committee for Regulation of Trade and Tourist Activity, a branch of the Ministry for Industry and Trade, is the body that manages tourism in Kazakhstan. Certain executive departments and tourism representatives from other countries carry out the administration of this committee.

      In 1997, Kazakhstan created the Strategy of tourism development, intended to be intact through 2030. Today, 430 tourism agencies, firms, and bureaus of various property forms function effectively in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They employ nearly 6,000 people and 1,500 professional guides. Kazakhstan tourism firms cooperate with almost 80 countries of the world; approximately 25 tourism firms in Almaty and five in regional centers arrange charter flights to the following countries:

      - India
      - Turkey
      - The United Arab Emirates
      - Pakistan
      - South Korea
      - Greece
      - Poland.

      There are also cooperative agreements with the following places:

      - Turkey
      - Iran,
      - The Xinjang Uigur Autonomous Area of China
      - Moldova
      - Hungary
      - The State of Israel
      - Kyrghyzstan
      - Egypt

      In addition to those already in place, Kazakhstan is in the process of making intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements with other nations, including:

      - Croatia
      - Pakistan
      - Singapore

      Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in United Kingdom tourists over the past few years, and with the recent visa simplification procedures (letters of invitation are no longer required of EU and US citizens) still greater numbers are expected.

  title: Nur-Sultan
  body: "Nur-Sultan is located in the center of Kazakhstan in the dry steppe zone
    and in the grass steppe subzone. The area of the city stands above the flood plain.
    The Yessil River is a major waterway of the capital. The city has an extreme continental
    climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan hosted the 2017 world's
    fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana Expo 2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s
    favourable location in the centre of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically
    advantageous transport, communication and logistics centre, and a natural bridge
    between Europe and Asia.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yrqt_3Po2LE\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
    picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe transfer of the capital
    to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
    high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
    in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for 10 percent,
    while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2 percent.\n\nThe city
    has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan. \n\nEntrepreneurship
    is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are more than 128,000 small and
    medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan is among the leading cities of
    the country in terms of the volume of construction. After the city became the
    capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres of housing facilities have been
    built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan and abroad took part in the construction
    of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural concept of Nur-Sultan was based on the idea
    of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying a special Eurasian style of Nur-Sultan should
    harmoniously combine the cultural traditions of both the East and the West. A
    well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa became the author of the general
    layout of the capital city.\n\nToday Nur-Sultan, located in the heart of Eurasia,
    is a venue for numerous international forums, congresses and large scale international
    events. The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, the Astana
    Economic Forum and other forums are held regularly in the city. In December, 2010,
    the historical Summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe
    took place in the capital city of Kazakhstan, after which it hosted the anniversary
    summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
    In early 2011, the city welcomed the participants and guests of the 7th Asian
    Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted the international specialized exhibition
    EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military district was founded in 1832 on the
    banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods. Until 1961, the name of this
    town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and because of its ideal location, it soon
    turned into a central point for trade livestock fairs. In 1961, the name was changed
    to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola in 1992. Astana was not the official name until
    1998. In 2019, the capital was renamed to Nur-Sultan after the First President
    of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n### Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n-
    In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s area was over 300 sq. km., but today, the city boundaries
    are rapidly expanding.\n- The distance between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the former
    capital, is 1,318 km.\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s population was about 300,000. This
    year (2009), the population has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn 1997,
    the President of Kazakhstan made the decision to relocate the capital of Kazakhstan
    from Almaty to Akmola city (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n- Advantageous
    geopolitical location\n- Considerable industrial potential\n- Crucial resources
    for subsequent development of the construction industry\n- Location in the largest
    transport junction\n- Essential transport and telecommunication infrastructure\n-
    Highly skilled urban workforce\n- Large private sector\n- Potentialities for entrepreneurship
    development\n- Political and social stability\n- Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe
    most important reason for moving the capital and expanding and improving the city
    of Nur-Sultan was to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically
    stable and prosperous, democratically viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt
    Nur-Sultan’s historical inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From now
    on any major decisions important for the future of the people will be made here
    in the centre of this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland is beating
    here. Kazakhstan is making and defining its history and destiny here and today.”\n\nIn
    1998, the decision was made to officially change the name of the new capital Akmola
    to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year later, the Astana from waterUnited Nations
    Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) granted the status,
    “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe city’s rapid growth as the administrative and
    business center of the country matches the original concept for social and economic
    development. The theme of this concept is “The blossoming of Astana is the blossoming
    of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More than 200 joint ventures and foreign companies are operating
    in the capital, including those belonging to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n-
    Kyrgyzstan\n- Switzerland.\n \nAstana is a member of the International Association
    of Capitals and Cultural Cities of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS);
    it also has close bilateral relations with 13 cities and regions of the CIS.\n\n__The
    growth of Astana, as a result of it becoming the new capital, has had a powerful
    influence on neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n- Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n-
    East Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also supported the development of
    entrepreneurship and businesses which will, in turn, lead to the opening of foreign
    companies, firms, and major bank branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business
    Magnet__\n\nAstana is a major center of activity and the hub of national and international
    transport links. The extensive traffic is mainly due to strong economic ties between:\n\n-
    South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The Volga
    region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government have
    spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and 2004, the number
    of new legal entities registered in the capital more than doubled, and the local
    housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers of the capital city’s
    economic activity are:__\n\n- Construction\n- The food industry\n- Tourism\n\nThe
    city boasts a growing number of restaurants and hotels that cater to business
    travelers. Major exhibition centers and universities, such as the L. Gumilyov
    Eurasian University, can be found within Astana. The A. Barayev Research Institute
    of Grain Farming is another establishment, not only famous in Kazakhstan but within
    the scientific world. In addition to the three museums, Astana also has branches
    of the Union of Writers and Artists of Kazakhstan, with over 40 newspapers and
    two literary magazines being published in the city.\n\n__Tourist Attractions__\n\n__Astana’s
    tourist attractions include:__\n\n- Astana-Baiterek, a monument to the country’s
    independence with a sweeping view of the city\n- A circus\n- An ethnic park\n-
    A presidential culture museum\n- The world’s most inland aquarium\n- A 10,000-seat
    skating stadium and cycle track.\n\nAdditionally, Astana is fast becoming a mecca
    for sports tourism; new sport centers are planned for the neighboring areas of
    Korgalzhyn and Ereimentau.\n\n__Culture and the Arts__\n\nThe Presidential Cultural
    Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established in the center of Astana.
    The structure of the Center includes a museum Cultural Centerwith various rooms
    and displays representing Kazakhstan’s past and present values. In addition, the
    Center has a library containing more than a million books and electronic catalogues.\n\nThe
    Kazakh National Music Academy has also been established in Astana. This Academy
    combines specialized and general musical education into one school. The Academy
    is a member of the European Association of Conservatories, Academies and Musical
    High Schools.\n\n__Spectators enjoy visiting theaters such as:__\n\n- The Theater
    of Drama and Music, named after K. Kuanyshbaev and opened on November 15, 1991\n-
    The State Theater of Russian Drama, named after M. Gorky\n- The National Opera
    and Ballet Theater, named after K Baiseitova and opened in Cinema City2000.\n\nIn
    addition to theaters, the pristine new cinema complex, Cinema-City, was opened
    in 2000. It was built in the tradition of international cinemas and has become
    a favorite of the people of Astana.\n\n__Eighth Wonder of the World__\n\nIn September
    2006, the inauguration of the Palace of Peace and Accord (62 meters in height),
    also known as the Peace Pyramid, marked another milestone in Astana’s evolution
    and may well become the Eighth Wonder of the World. Built to house the Assembly
    of Nations of Kazakhstan, a university, a museum, a library and a winter garden,
    the pyramid was designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster, who is famous
    for his futuristic glass roof on the German Parliament, the Reichstag.\n\n__Special
    Economic Zone__\n\nConstruction of the new city developments on left bank of the
    Esil River has started. To aid in this process, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ),
    providing more favorable conditions for investment, has been created. According
    to the General Development Plan of the Capital, the integrated structure of this
    complex, located on the left bank, will symbolize the new capital.\n\n__The creation
    of the SEZ will provide many benefits to both the state and potential investors,
    including:__\n\n- State support of direct investments into construction of Astana
    city\n- Significant tax privileges and preferentials\n- Opportunities to introduce
    modern technologies and scientific achievements in the field of construction\n-
    Land for construction in the new center of the capital\n- Formation and development
    of the real estate market\n- Guaranteed right to prolong the investment activity
    on the initial terms, until the expiration of the SEZ period. This cannot exceed
    ten years, irrespective of the changes in the juridical regime of the SEZ or its
    liquidation before the appointed time, including the extension of the area. \n\nThe
    Customs regulation in the territory of the SEZ is applied in accordance to the
    customs legislature of Republic of Kazakhstan. The territory of the SEZ is considered
    to be a part of the customs-free territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n__The
    following goods and equipment are customs-free:__\n\n- Machines and equipment
    for construction\n- Goods that will be completely consumed in construction\n-
    Goods and equipment necessary for construction.\n\n__Products__\n\nThe region

        value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its territory
          is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape is far from uniform,
          as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains, and river valleys. In the
          North is found the Kokshetau summit; in the southern and south-eastern portions
          of the region is the Saryarka, part of the Kazakh topography; and plains
          compose the North-East.

    To promote tourism, Kazakhstan enforced a “Law on Tourism” (1992) that embraces virtually all types of tourism. __The law also addresses key issues of tourism activities:__

    - Legal
    - Economic
    - Social
    - Organizational

    In addition to this law, the Government has adopted several enactments concerning tourism concerns, including a number of documents that regulate the licensing of tourism activities. In 1993, the National Program for developing Kazakhstan’s tourism industry was adopted, and in 1997, the Government passed the State Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, designed to accomplish the following goals:

    - Regenerate historic centers of the Great Silk Route
    - Preserve and development the cultural legacy of Turkic-speaking states
    - Create the tourism infrastructure from 1997-2003.

    Additionally, Kazakhstan became a member of the World Tourism Organization in 1993.
    The Committee for Regulation of Trade and Tourist Activity, a branch of the Ministry for Industry and Trade, is the body that manages tourism in Kazakhstan. Certain executive departments and tourism representatives from other countries carry out the administration of this committee.

    In 1997, Kazakhstan created the Strategy of tourism development, intended to be intact through 2030. Today, 430 tourism agencies, firms, and bureaus of various property forms function effectively in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They employ nearly 6,000 people and 1,500 professional guides. Kazakhstan tourism firms cooperate with almost 80 countries of the world; approximately 25 tourism firms in Almaty and five in regional centers arrange charter flights to the following countries:

    - India
    - Turkey
    - The United Arab Emirates
    - Pakistan
    - South Korea
    - Greece
    - Poland.

    There are also cooperative agreements with the following places:

    - Turkey
    - Iran,
    - The Xinjang Uigur Autonomous Area of China
    - Moldova
    - Hungary
    - The State of Israel
    - Kyrghyzstan
    - Egypt

    In addition to those already in place, Kazakhstan is in the process of making intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements with other nations, including:

    - Croatia
    - Pakistan
    - Singapore

    Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in United Kingdom tourists over the past few years, and with the recent visa simplification procedures (letters of invitation are no longer required of EU and US citizens) still greater numbers are expected.

  title: Democracy
  body: "Kazakhstan is a constitutional republic and is a fledging democracy after
    a long period of being a republic of the former Soviet Union.  According to Kazakhstan’s
    constitution, Kazakhstan's democracy is secular and values individual “life, rights,
    and freedoms.” Kazakhstan’s Constitution also establishes key democratic principles
    of the separation of powers, equality and the institution of elections in Kazakhstan.\n\nSince
    independence, the Kazakh people have steadily built the values of Kazakhstan's
    democracy. Kazakhstan improved its positioning in international ratings. For example,
    in the Corruption Perception Index prepared by Transparency International Kazakhstan
    has shown continued rank improvement year over year. \n\n<div style=\"display:
    flex; justify-content: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/img/kz/osce-alignment.png\"
    style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n\nSince its independence from the
    Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan's democracy has consistently become more stable.
    [The transition to democracy](http://kznewsline.com/tag/kazakhstan-democracy/)
    in Kazakhstanresulted in the establishment of a Secular Constitution in 1995.
    Constitution, modeled after Western models of the separation of powers, outlines
    the responsibilities of the executive, legislative and judicial branches.  The
    executive power is under the President, the Government and the Ministries. The
    Senate and the Mazhilis control legislative powers. Lastly, the Constitutional
    Council and the Supreme Court control judicial power.\n\nThe first presidential
    elections in Kazakhstan were held in January 1999 with the election of former
    Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh (SSR) Nursultan Nazarbayev, who
    was subsequently re-elected in 2006 and in 2011 to serve for five-years, pursuant
    to a 2007 constitutional amendment that shortened the Presidential term by two
    years. This new amendment also reinforced the Parliament`s authority.  In early
    2009, a law was adopted on political groups that ensures the presence of at least
    two parties in Parliament. In January 2012, parliamentary elections were held
    using a closed, party-list system. President Nazarbayev’s party Nur Otan garnered
    80.99% of the vote, followed by the Ak Jol party (7.47%) and the Communist People's
    Party of Kazakhstan (KNPK) (7.19%). The four opposition parties all received less
    than the required 7% minimum to qualify for representation in Parliament.\n\nThe
    Kazakh people on June 9, 2019 [elected](https://astanatimes.com/2019/06/tokayev-wins-kazakhstans-presidency-with-70-76-percent-of-vote-official-preliminary-results-say/)
    Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with 70.76% of the popular vote. Tokayev was one of [seven
    candidates](https://astanatimes.com/2019/05/seven-candidates-compete-for-countrys-highest-office-in-june-9-election/)
    running in the election. \n "

          Learning and Teaching Initiative (PILTI), which upgraded the technological
          capacity of thousands of secondary schools. Launched in 2007 by former Minister
          of Education and Science Zhanseit Tuimebayev, the PILTI aims to enhance
          the teaching of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) by providing
          schools with a 21st century learning environment. To do that, education
          officials have assembled a team of the world’s top suppliers of innovative
          education products, including members of the UK consortium TVET UK and the
          California-based firm Pasco Scientific. In the less than five years since
          its launch, PILTI has facilitated the installation of new STEM and language
          teaching technologies in more than 20,000 classrooms across the country.
          More than 40,000 Kazakh teachers have been trained to use these new tools
          and incorporate them into a pedagogical method that emphasizes student participation,
          rather than lecturing.

    title: Bolashak Scholarship
    body: |-
      In 1993, Kazakhstan was the first Central Asian country to launch a presidential scholarship program, ‘Bolashak’, for international study. ‘Bolashak’, which means ‘future’ in Kazakh, speaks to the importance Kazakhstan puts on educating its youth at the best universities in the world. The Bolashak Programme is an all-expenses paid scholarship sponsored by awarded to high-performing students from Kazakhstan for graduate study at an overseas university. Upon completion of their graduate degree, Bolashak scholars are required to return to work in Kazakhstan for at least five years. The program is designed to train future leaders in business, international relations, law, science, engineering and other key fields.

      Since its implementation in 1993, more than 6,500 students have been awarded the scholarship, with most choosing to study in the United States and Great Britain.They have successfully graduated from America’s leading universities including Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Emory, Carnegie Mellon, Indiana University, Vanderbilt and many others.

  title: President of Kazakhstan
  body: "The President of Kazakhstan is Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.  \n\nKazakhstan's first
    president is Nursultan Nazarbayev and retains the title of First President. He
    came to leadership in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan
    in the former Soviet Union, and was democratically elected as the first president
    of independent Kazakhstan in 1991.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan
    inherited more than 400 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear weapon
    test site. In August 1991, President Nazarbayev signed a historic decree to close
    the Semipalatinsk test site and worked with the United States to safely secure
    those nuclear warheads and nuclear materials. Under the leadership of President
    Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan has gone a long way from promoting nuclear disarmament
    using the platforms of international organizations to playing a leading role in
    building a nuclear weapons free world.\n\nKazakhstan’s President Nazarbayev enjoys
    high popularity among Kazakh citizens, which can be attributed to the country's
    impressive economic growth. In the 2000s, Kazakhstan’s economy grew sharply. In
    order to sustain the economic growth and develop country’s infrastructure, President
    Nazarbayev introduced New Economic Policy Nurly Zhol in November 2014. Nurly Zhol
    targets seven major areas of infrastructure development, such as energy, housing,
    industrial infrastructure, transportation and logistics, small and medium enterprises,
    public utilities and social infrastructure.\n\nIn April of 2015, [Nursultan Nazarbayev](http://ortcom.kz/en) was [reelected](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-witt/kazakhstans-presidential-_b_847612.html) to

          400 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear weapon test site. In
          August 1991, President Nazarbayev signed a historic decree to close the
          Semipalatinsk test site and worked with the United States to safely secure
          those nuclear warheads and nuclear materials. Under the leadership of President
          Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan has gone a long way from promoting nuclear disarmament
          using the platforms of international organizations to playing a leading
          role in building a nuclear weapons free world.

      U.S. President Barack Obama sent a letter to Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev  congratulating him on his new term in office following the April 26 election and saying he was looking forward to working with him on global and regional security issues, the Akorda announced on April 29.

      In this file photo from the March 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, U.S. President Barack Obama thanked the President of Kazakhstan for his contribution to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

      “The United States and Kazakhstan have a strong history of working closely together to address global and regional challenges successfully,” Obama wrote in his letter, according to the announcement. “I look forward to continuing to deepen our bilateral relationship and strategic partnership for the benefit of both our peoples.”
      The U.S. president noted that the United States, in partnership with Kazakhstan, was providing support for security in Afghanistan and advancing common goals in nuclear nonproliferation. 

      “In a world of many threats, long-term stability and security cannot be achieved without the development of representative and accountable institutions and civil society. I look forward to working together with you on all these important issues for the benefit of both our countries,” the letter said, as quoted by the Akorda.

      On behalf of the American people, Obama extended warm greetings to the people of Kazakhstan and wishes for prosperity, peace and well-being. 

      Following his win in Sunday’s election with 97.7 percent of the vote, President Nazarbayev was inaugurated into his new term as Kazakhstan’s President in an April 29 ceremony at the Palace of Independence in Astana in the presence of members of Parliament, cabinet officials and foreign ambassadors. 

      In his inaugural speech, the newly reinstalled president pledged to move quickly on implementing his campaign platform of five institutional reforms that focus on building a meritocratic government, strengthening the rule of law and developing the middle class. President Nazarbayev said he would move quickly to appoint the National Modernisation Commission and that he would introduce a 100-step “Plan for the Nation” as a guide for introducing reforms at the commission’s first session.

      In related news, the European Union released a statement on April 28 saying “Kazakhstan is a key partner for the EU, and we stand ready to continue our support to the implementation of further reforms to strengthen democracy in Kazakhstan." Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev enjoys high popularity among Kazakh citizens.

    title: Mazhilis Election 2016
    body: |
      On March 20, 2016, Kazakhs went to the polls to elect a new Mazhilis - lower chamber of Parliament.  234 candidates campaigned for the 98 seats. Voter turnout was reported to be 77%. By the Kazakh constitution, 9 seats are appointed by the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan.   

      817 foreign observers monitored the election and ballot casting. The OSCE/ODIHR deployed an Election Observation Mission (EOM) consisting of 15 core team experts from 13 participating States, 28 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers. Bundestag (German Parliament) Foreign Policy Advisor Andreas Jahn visited polling station number 120 in Astana and [noted the procedure](https://astanatimes.com/2016/03/2/) as fair and transparent. “It was very interesting to observe the voting process and we were waiting for the upcoming results with the others. As I can observe, the election process was intense, a lot of people were involved. We also assisted in the counting of votes at the end of the day,” he said.

      The [results of the electon](http://www.election.kz/rus/news/messages/index.php?ID=3294) were:
      82.20 % - Nur Otan 
      7.18 % - Democratic Party of Kazakhstan Ak Zhol
      7.14 % - Communist People's Party of Kazakhstan
      2.01 % - Kazakhstani Social Democratic Party Auyl

  title: Presidential Elections 2015
  body: |+
    U.S. President Barack Obama sent a letter to Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev  congratulating him on his new term in office following the April 26 election and saying he was looking forward to working with him on global and regional security issues, the Akorda announced on April 29.

    In this file photo from the March 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, U.S. President Barack Obama thanked the President of Kazakhstan for his contribution to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

    “The United States and Kazakhstan have a strong history of working closely together to address global and regional challenges successfully,” Obama wrote in his letter, according to the announcement. “I look forward to continuing to deepen our bilateral relationship and strategic partnership for the benefit of both our peoples.”
    The U.S. president noted that the United States, in partnership with Kazakhstan, was providing support for security in Afghanistan and advancing common goals in nuclear nonproliferation. 

    “In a world of many threats, long-term stability and security cannot be achieved without the development of representative and accountable institutions and civil society. I look forward to working together with you on all these important issues for the benefit of both our countries,” the letter said, as quoted by the Akorda.

    On behalf of the American people, Obama extended warm greetings to the people of Kazakhstan and wishes for prosperity, peace and well-being. 

    Following his win in Sunday’s election with 97.7 percent of the vote, President Nazarbayev was inaugurated into his new term as Kazakhstan’s President in an April 29 ceremony at the Palace of Independence in Astana in the presence of members of Parliament, cabinet officials and foreign ambassadors. 

    In his inaugural speech, the newly reinstalled president pledged to move quickly on implementing his campaign platform of five institutional reforms that focus on building a meritocratic government, strengthening the rule of law and developing the middle class. President Nazarbayev said he would move quickly to appoint the National Modernisation Commission and that he would introduce a 100-step “Plan for the Nation” as a guide for introducing reforms at the commission’s first session.

    In related news, the European Union released a statement on April 28 saying “Kazakhstan is a key partner for the EU, and we stand ready to continue our support to the implementation of further reforms to strengthen democracy in Kazakhstan." Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev enjoys high popularity among Kazakh citizens.

  title: Mazhilis Election 2016
  body: |
    On March 20, 2016, Kazakhs went to the polls to elect a new Mazhilis - lower chamber of Parliament.  234 candidates campaigned for the 98 seats. Voter turnout was reported to be 77%. By the Kazakh constitution, 9 seats are appointed by the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan.   

    817 foreign observers monitored the election and ballot casting. The OSCE/ODIHR deployed an Election Observation Mission (EOM) consisting of 15 core team experts from 13 participating States, 28 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers. Bundestag (German Parliament) Foreign Policy Advisor Andreas Jahn visited polling station number 120 in Astana and [noted the procedure](https://astanatimes.com/2016/03/2/) as fair and transparent. “It was very interesting to observe the voting process and we were waiting for the upcoming results with the others. As I can observe, the election process was intense, a lot of people were involved. We also assisted in the counting of votes at the end of the day,” he said.

    The [results of the electon](http://www.election.kz/rus/news/messages/index.php?ID=3294) were:
    82.20 % - Nur Otan 
    7.18 % - Democratic Party of Kazakhstan Ak Zhol
    7.14 % - Communist People's Party of Kazakhstan
    2.01 % - Kazakhstani Social Democratic Party Auyl
    1.18 % - Nationwide Social Democratic Party
    0.29 % - Birlik

  title: Religious Freedom
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan is a multi-confessional secular state that guarantees constitutional freedom of worship and religion to each of its 46 religious denominations. Kazakhstan has earned international recognition for its promotion of religious freedom and belief as well as its efforts to tackle intolerance and discrimination both on domestic and international levels. Indeed, the absence of any inter-faith conflict since the independence more than 25 years ago is a testament to these efforts.

    The country’s 3,088 religious organizations are all free from government interference while the country’s leadership engages religious leaders on important social and cultural matters to foster peace and religious accord. Leaders of the largest religious associations are members of the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, the Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and local government organizations. There are more than 2,500 places of worship of diverse religions, including 2,268 mosques, 162 Russian Orthodox churches, 86 Roman Catholic churches, and 614 Protestant Christian churches. The Kazakh Jewish community has synagogues in Almaty, Astana, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kostanai, and Pavlodar.

    Kazakhstan’s religious freedom, diversity, tolerance, and its location on the crossroads of Europe and Asia make it an ideal country to facilitate global inter-faith conversation. The country has worked with partners on a bilateral and multilateral basis to develop a dialogue among civilizations and religions. Since 2003, every three years the country hosts the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. The forum welcomes Muslim, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and other religions’ representatives and aims to nurture discussion on how the spiritual and moral potential of world religions can be used to prevent international conflicts and address global threats, xenophobia and intolerance. Kazakhstan aims to have the forum function as a permanent international organization mandated with the implementation of decisions taken collectively by influential spiritual leaders.

    Kazakhstan cooperates with the United States in the human rights and religious freedom protection. One of the platforms for effective dialogue is the [Annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom](https://www.state.gov/ministerial-to-advance-religious-freedom/) hosted by the U.S. Secretary of State. The [1st inaugural Ministerial](https://blogs.state.gov/stories/2018/07/27/en/united-states-hosts-first-ever-ministerial-advance-international-religious) was held on July 24-26, 2018. The 2nd Ministerial took place on July 16-18, 2019. Kazakhstan delegation was led by Minister of Information and Social Development Mr Dauren Abayev.

    Within the United Nations framework Kazakhstan has been [actively promoting](https://astanatimes.com/2015/02/dialogue-peace-harmony/) inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue. In 2005 Kazakhstan was one of the main sponsors of the UN Resolution on Promotion of Inter-religious Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace. During the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures in 2010, initiated by [First President Nursultan Nazarbayev](http://kazakhstanun.com/discover-kazakhstan/kazakhstan-president-nazarbayev/) in the 62nd session of the UN General Assembly, more than 1000 events were held around the world by member states, international and regional partners and UNESCO. Building on the success of this initiative and with Kazakhstan’s advocacy, the UN General Assembly then adopted a resolution proclaiming the years 2013-2022 the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures.

    Kazakhstan has used its presidencies of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) in 2011 and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2010 as platforms for strengthening West-East dialogue. During the OSCE presidency Kazakhstan hosted High-Level Conference on Tolerance and non-Discrimination in Astana to promote the values of tolerance, non-discrimination inter-cultural dialogue.

    All these efforts reflect the country’s commitment to promotion of peace, harmony, and religious tolerance.

    __Kazakh Literature__

    Kazakh literature is the literature created in the modern state of Kazakhstan, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, the Kazakh part of the Russian Empire, and the Kazakh Khanate. There is some overlap with several complementary themes, including the literature of Turkic tribes that inhabited Kazakhstan over the course of the history and literature written by ethnic Kazakhs.

    __Medieval Literature__

    According to Chinese written sources of 6th-8th centuries CE, Turkic tribes of Kazakhstan had oral poetry tradition. Traces of this tradition are shown on stone carvings dated 5th-7th centuries C.E. that describes rule of Kultegin and Bilge, two early Turkic rulers ("kagans").

    Book of Dede Korkut and Oguz Name (a story of ancient Turkic king Oghuz Khan) are the most well-known Turkic heroic legends. Initially created around 9th century CE, they were passed over the generations in oral form these legends were recorded by Turkish authors in 14-16th centuries C.E.

    __Abay Kunanbayev__

    The preemininent role in the development of modern literary Kazakh belongs to Abay Qunanbayuli (or Kunanbayev, Kazakh: Абай Құнанбайұлы) (1845–1904), whose writings did much to preserve Kazakh folk culture. Abay's major work is The Book of Words (Kazakh: қара сөздері, Qara sözderi), a philosophical treatise and collection of poems where he criticizes Russian colonial policies and encourages other Kazakhs to embrace education and literacy.

  title: Syria Peace Talks
  body: |
    Astana has served as a neutral, objective host venue for talks between the Syrian government and the opposition that began on Janurary 23, 2017.  Russia, Turkey and Iran have served as guarantors of the negotiations.  All sides have made it clear that the upcoming talks are not an alternative to the Geneva Process and instead will complement it. The main task of the talks in Astana is to create the conditions to resolve the conflict in Syria through the framework of the Geneva negotiations. Kazakhstan is offering a platform for the talks and will not be taking part in the negotiations.

    The talks demonstrate that Kazakhstan is an open, friendly and modern country, as well as subtly communicate Kazakhstan’s contributions to global peace and security and its role as an objective mediator and a respected global partner.

    1. Astana was chosen as a suitable platform to host these negotiations due to the fact that Kazakhstan is objective and neutral in its approach, as well as a reliable partner for all nations. Kazakhstan has friendly relations with Russia, Turkey, European Union states, as well as the United States.

    2. Kazakhstan has built a reputation as an honest broker in international diplomacy across such issues as the Iran nuclear talks and the crisis in Ukraine.

    3. Kazakhstan has experience acting as a mediator. The country has already hosted two rounds of talks involving representatives of the Syrian opposition in 2015. President Nursultan Nazarbayev also played a central role in mending relations between Russia and Turkey. Without President’s Nursultan Nazarbayev’s contribution, it is unlikely that these talks would have been arranged.

    4. Kazakhstan has contributed to resolving the humanitarian crisis in Syria. The country sent approximately 500 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Syria this year in the form of food. Humanitarian assistance was also provided last year.

    5. Kazakhstan is determined to play its role in ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East, especially given the geographical proximity to the region. Following the talks, Kazakhstan will continue with its efforts to bring lasting peace and security to the Middle East, including through its initiatives at the UN Security Council.

              due to the fact that Kazakhstan is objective and neutral in its approach,

              relations with Russia, Turkey, European Union states, as well as the
              United States.

              Syrian opposition in 2015. President Nursultan Nazarbayev also played
              a central role in mending relations between Russia and Turkey. Without
              President’s Nursultan Nazarbayev’s contribution, it is unlikely that
              these talks would have been arranged.

  title: Pharmaceuticals
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan’s pharmaceutical market, on the other hand, is the most accessible, transparent and, from a legislative point of view, progressive in Central Asia. Currently, some 70% of domestically consumed medicine is imported, while 30% are internally manufactured. 

    The government adopted a resolution on “__The State Program for the Development of Pharmaceutical Industry for 2010-2014__,” with the objective of increasing domestic production of pharmaceuticals from 30 to 50% by the end of 2014. Under the program, foreign manufactures are eligible to obtain equal treatment with domestic ones if they decide to produce domestically.

    title: Anti-corruption
    body: "Fighting corruption is one of the priorities of President Tokayev and is
      fundamental to Kazakhstan’s 100 Concrete Steps programme, the massive reform
      project intended to accelerate the country’s development, and realization of
      Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy goals. Kazakhstan has developed an effective legal
      and institutional platform to facilitate the anti-corruption policies. The Civil
      Service Affairs and Anti-Corruption Agency works on detecting and stopping corruption
      offenses in all spheres. \n\nPresident Tokayev [signed a law](https://astanatimes.com/2019/12/tokayev-signs-law-making-ministers-and-governors-responsible-for-corruption-among-subordinates/)
      in December 2019 making ministers and akims (governors) responsible for corruption
      among their direct subordinates Nov. 28. The law introduces amendments that
      will oblige ministers and governors to resign if the top officials in their
      institutions are found guilty of corruption.\n\nKazakhstan's National Bureau
      of Anti-Corruption has established close cooperation with the United States,
      the United Nations (UNO), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
      (OSCE), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Transparency
      International and others. Kazakhstan has pledged to provide information on anticorruption
      measures, involve NGOs in anticorruption policies and continue to develop an
      anti-corruption culture. The Modern Anti-Corruption Standards and Development
      of International Cooperation [international conference](https://www.iaca.int/medias/news/974-iaca-emphasizes-international-cooperation-at-astana-anti-corruption-conference.html)
      in Nur-sultan in 2017 resulted in adopting recommendations on the modern anti-corruption
      standards.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\" style=\"border-left-style:

    title: Astana International Finance Centre
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan enters a new phase of the development after a period of high economic growth. The crisis of 2007-2009 was successfully overcome through the use of accumulated resources. Sovereign wealth funds, established in the previous years, played a major role in the economic development. With the falling prices for the country's main export commodities, new approaches to public policy are necessary. In particular, diversification of economy, better management of the accumulated funds and assets, as well as the development of a financial services market have become important. At the same time, the country's integration into regional cooperation organisations and the Eurasian Economic Union creates conditions for accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan into the global financial system. 

      Five institutional reforms of the Head of State and Hundred Concrete Steps Program to implement these reforms (hereinafter – Plan of the Nation) have become a new starting point in the development of Kazakhstan. As part of the Plan of the Nation, [Astana International Financial Centre](http://www.aifc.kz/) (hereinafter – AIFC) was established at the order of the President of Republic of Kazakhstan with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition (hereinafter – EXPO-2017) infrastructure. 

      A Constitutional Law providing favourable environment for the AIFC participants was passed for a successful launch of the AIFC. The main goal of AIFC, like of any other state reform, is to improve welfare of Kazakhstan residents. Various aspects of the AIFC shall allow improving the approaches to managing sovereign wealth funds and facilitating the transfer of foreign knowledge and technology to the country, thus, ensuring an increase and the development of human capital. The slowdown of business cycles in the country due to the deteriorating conditions in foreign markets and unfavourable geopolitical situation in the region, only justifies the need for a financial centre - it is important now more than ever to attract new investments in the financial capital, as well as in technology and human capital. The initiative to establish an international financial centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development. 

      In order to establish AIFC as a local centre of expertise with a developed capital market and later to develop it into a regional platform for financial intermediation, the strategy for the development of AIFC has been developed until 2021, inclusive. Implementing the initial phase of the development of the AIFC shall serve as a solid foundation for the realisation of the subsequent phases, namely, development into a regional financial centre, and eventually, into an international financial centre. The strategy for the development of AIFC shall be reviewed upon the implementation of each phase of the development due to a change of goals and objectives.

    title: Doing Business
    body: |-
      The Government of Kazakhstan has made significant efforts to remove bureaucratic obstacles to investment and the creation of an attractive business environment, which has been consistently reflected in the last four editions of the World Bank’s Doing Business report as well as other internationally recognized indices.  

      <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/global-rankings/" width="100%" height="700px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

      The Constitution affords foreign investors the same rights and obligations as Kazakh nationals. The Investment Code guarantees foreign firms equality between local and foreign investors, protection of investor’s rights, arbitration of disputes, guarantees against nationalization and affirms the right to repatriate profits. Thanks to these, the country ranks 22nd in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank. Foreign firms invest in almost all sectors of the economy.

      The country has a comprehensive system promoting inflow of FDI into domestic-oriented production and export-oriented local production. The government provides investment preferences such as exemptions from customs duties, state grants in kind, privileges relating to land tax and property tax for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects, and industrial privileges for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects in residential areas with a low level of social economic development.

      In 2019, FDI amounted to almost $25 billion, the equivalent of 10% of GDP, and has brought new technology and jobs for domestic suppliers and subcontractors and has generated new types of employment and training for Kazakhs. The majority of FDI has targeted the oil, gas and mining sectors and associated services, so the government puts a large emphasis on encouraging investment in industries other than oil & gas and mining as part of its 2050 Strategy. To eliminate the dependence on resource extraction industries, the government adopted plans to focus on diversification of economy to become knowledge-based modern economy.

      The government's efforts to strengthen the state's fiscal balance, reduce national debt, and aid the recovery of the banking sector following the 2007-08 crisis prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade Kazakhstan's sovereign rating to BBB + with a stable outlook in November 2012. Kazakhstan’s progressive, pro-business laws also support the growth of foreign investment and stronger economic growth. Doing business in Kazakhstan becomes easier and more inviting for foreign investors each year.

            in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank. Foreign firms invest
            in almost all sectors of the economy.

          value: The country has a comprehensive system promoting inflow of FDI into
            domestic-oriented production and export-oriented local production. The
            government provides investment preferences such as exemptions from customs
            duties, state grants in kind, privileges relating to land tax and property
            tax for legal entities carrying out strategic investment projects, and
            industrial privileges for legal entities carrying out strategic investment
            projects in residential areas with a low level of social economic development.

          value: In 2013, FDI amounted to almost $25 billion, the equivalent of 10%
            of GDP, and has brought new technology and jobs for domestic suppliers
            and subcontractors and has generated new types of employment and training
            for Kazakhs. The majority of FDI has targeted the oil, gas and mining
            sectors and associated services, so the government puts a large emphasis
            on encouraging investment in industries other than oil & gas and mining
            as part of its 2050 Strategy. To eliminate the dependence on resource
            extraction industries, the government adopted plans to focus on diversification
            of economy to become knowledge-based modern economy.

          value: The government's efforts to strengthen the state's fiscal balance,
            reduce national debt, and aid the recovery of the banking sector following
            the 2007-08 crisis prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade Kazakhstan's sovereign
            rating to BBB + with a stable outlook in November 2012. Kazakhstan’s progressive,
            pro-business laws also support the growth of foreign investment and stronger
            economic growth. Doing business in Kazakhstan becomes easier and more
            inviting for foreign investors each year.

      ### Invest in Kazakhstan
      Kazakhstan's Investment Code guarantees foreign firms equality between local and foreign investors, protection of investor’s rights, arbitration of disputes, guarantees against nationalization and the right to repatriate profits.

      __Kazakhstan ranks 22nd in the Investor Protection Index of the World Bank.__

      Kazakhstan has institutions to promote and support investment, including KazNexInvest and the Foreign Investors’ Council, and now plans to establish a new role of an investment ombudsman to help facilitate communication between investors and the government and help investors address their issues. In recent years, the government has also used joint ventures as an effective instrument to bring in foreign expertize and capital it needs to co-fund industries such as construction, logistics, petrochemicals, manufacturing and IT.

      __Incentives for Priority Projects__

      Kazakhstan has established a highly preferential regime for those investment projects classified as “priority investment projects”. The primary criterion for a Project is investment of not less than approx. USD 20 million in one of the areas specified by the Government.

      Those who invest in Kazakhstan and conclude an investment contract for a Project with the authorized body (currently the Investments Committee under the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies), may enjoy the following advantages (as specifically set out in an investment contract):

      __1) exemption from corporate income tax (20%) for up to 10 years;__

      __2) exemption from land tax for up to 10 years;__

      __3) exemption from property tax for up to 8 years from the date when fixed assets (e.g., a plant) are commissioned (only for those assets which were commissioned for the first time);__

      __4) reimbursement of up to 30 percent of actual expenses on construction works and purchase of equipment (so-called “investment subsidy” (*4)) on the basis of documentary evidence after full commissioning. To apply for an investment subsidy, an applicant must also provide a feasibility study approved by the state expertise. The Government will approve the rules on granting investment subsidies;__

      __5) exemption from the need to obtain work permits for foreign workers of the legal entity holding the investment contract, its contractors and subcontractors in the area of research and design activities, engineering services and construction works. Such exemption is valid until the expiration of 1 year from the date of commissioning. The list of professions and number of attracted staff is set out in the investment contract;__

      __6) stability with regard to the above tax preferences and “work permits-free” regime;__

      __7) interaction with the Investments Committee under the principle of “one window”. An investor shall only file an application to the Investments Committee with related documents and negotiate further with the Committee regarding conditions of the investment contract;__

      __8) simplified procedure for obtaining land plots for a Project;__

      __9) assistance from the Investments Committee with regard to obtaining a guaranteed order(s) from national state-owned companies;__

      __10) (this preference existed earlier and remains valid) exemption from customs fees for the import of technological equipment and spare parts, for the period of an investment contract, but not more than 5 years.__

    title: Investment Policy
    body: "Due to political and economic stability in Kazakhstan, the abundance of
      natural resources, as well as high annual economic growth over the past several
      years, foreign investors continue invest in Kazakhstan and view it as a favorable
      place to do business.\nOne of the most important issues to foreign investors
      is the repatriation of their profits and the tax implications of their income.
      Civil legislation allows foreign investors to operate in Kazakhstan through
      either a local branch of a foreign company or a local subsidiary established
      as an independent legal entity under the laws of Kazakhstan. Naturally, a foreign
      investor should determine which type of investment structure is preferable.\n\n###
      Foreign Investors’ Council\nThe [Foreign Investors’ Council (FIC)](https://fic.kz/eng/)
      is an advisory body established by the Order of the President of the Republic
      of Kazakhstan to promote direct dialogue between the government and those who
      invest in Kazakhstan in order to efficiently address key issues related to their
      investment activities in the country, to improve the investment climate of Kazakhstan
      for the benefit of foreign investors, local and national companies, the economic
      development and wealth of the country and its people.\n\nThe FIC is chaired
      by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, who supervises its activities,
      including approval of the Agenda and chairmanship at the Council's plenary sessions.\n\n###
      The major objectives of the FIC \nDeveloping and submitting recommendations
      to the President and Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on key investment
      and economic development issues. Analyzing and discussing other core investment
      policy issues upon the instruction of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan
      is represented in the Council by the following government officials: Prime Minister,
      Chairman of the National Bank, Deputy Head of the President’s Administration,
      Deputy Prime-Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Industry and
      New Technologies, Minister of Finance, Minister of Economic Development and
      Trade, and Head of the Executive Body of the Council (Chairman of the Committee
      on Investments of the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies). \n\nThe foreign
      side of the Council is represented by top managers of international organizations,
      economic and financial institutions, foreign companies and corporations. The
      Plenary Sessions of the Council are conducted once or twice a year. For more
      information about current members of the FIC, please visit www.fic.kz.\nInvestment
      Ombudsman\n\nKazakhstan is putting in its best efforts to ensure the continuing
      improvement of its business and investment climate. The establishment of a task
      force on the protection of rights of foreign investors, the so-called “investment
      ombudsman”, is the most recent example of those efforts. \n\nThe institution
      of Investment Ombudsman was established in the Law on Investment adopted in
      2014. In December 2015, Minister of Investment and Development Asset Issekeshev
      was appointed as the the Investment Ombudsman of Kazakhstan. Issekeshev began
      his duties January 1, 2016. \n\nThe institution is based on international best
      practices, in particular on the successful experience of South Korea where this
      institution had been functioning since 1999 and helped resolve all 4,500 complaints
      between 2000 and 2012 without any one of them reaching the courts.\n\nAnyone
      who invests in Kazakhstan, or an embassy on their behalf, will be able to appeal
      to the investment ombudsman on specific issues and problems and file requests
      both through the Secretariat, located at the Investment Committee of the Ministry
      of Industry and New Technologies, and the Investors’ Support Center at the National
      Agency for Export and Investments KAZNEX INVEST, which is a part of the structure
      of the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies of Kazakhstan."

  title: Culture
  body: |-
    Kazakhstan is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse in the world. This owes in part to its geography, situated in between the major world religions, but also to Soviet ethno-policies and the settlement of European migrants throughout the 20th century. Ethnic and religious tolerance have deep roots in Kazakhstan: It was in this part of the Islamic world where the Sufist tradition of Islam earned some of the strongest positions, and Kazakh nomads are known for their hospitality and openness to external influences.

    Today, Kazakhstan hosts nearly 130 different ethnic groups and 17 different religious confessions. In 2010, the ethnic Kazakhs accounted for 65% of the population, the Russians 25.9%, with the remainder being spread among Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars, Uyghurs, Byelorussians, Azeris, Turks, Koreans, Dungans, Poles, Greeks, and other ethnic groups. In the 2009 Census, 70% of Kazakhstan’s population identified themselves as Muslim and 26% Christians, which corresponds roughly with the share of peoples of Asian and European origins in Kazakhstan’s polity. While historically divided into zhuzes and smaller tribal formations, ethnic Kazakhs still view themselves in terms of a single body or - in popular parlance - “branches of the same Kazakh tree”. 

    <iframe src="https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/seven-facets/" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    During the Tsarist Empire’s colonization in the 19th Century, more than a million settlers from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus came to the territories comprising modern day Kazakhstan. In the late 1920s and 1930s, Soviet collectivization and industrialization prompted the migration of an additional 1.4 million Europeans. In total, around 800,000 Germans, 185,000 Koreans, 102,000 Polish, 507,000 North Caucasians, and sizeable numbers of Crimean Tatars, Turks, Greeks, and Kalmyks were deported to Kazakhstan under Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin. Kazakhstan’s diverse society is an integral part of its nationhood. Thus, “the huge potential for integration into Kazakh culture for every ethnic group of the country”, President Nazarbayev has noted, “may be realized only through the open character of the Kazakh culture itself”.

    title: Alphabet
    body: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree October 26, 2017 to
      modernize the existing Kazakh alphabet to Latin-based script, and amended his
      decree in February 2018 to better modernize some characters. President Nazarbayev
      announced his intention to switch from the Cyrillic-based alphabet to Latin
      script in April 2012. The new alphabet consists of 32 letters and letters of
      the old Cyrillic alphabet will be replaced by Latin analogues based on their
      phonetic similarity. Kazakhs used Arabic script from the 10th-20th centuries.
      The Kazakh language was based on Latin script in 1929-1940. The transition to
      the Cyrillic alphabet occurred in 1940. The Latin alphabet is currently used
      by most Kazakh diasporas abroad.

    title: Ethnic Groups
    body: |-
      The population of Kazakhstan is various by its ethnical compound. Representatives of 130 nationalities live here. The local ethnos – Kazakhs make the largest part of the population – 58.9%, while Russian – 25.9%, Ukrainians – 2.9%, Uzbeks – 2,8%, Uighur, Tatar and German - 1.5% each, and other groups 4,3%. There are more than 100 ethnic groups living in peace in Kazakhstan.

      Many nationalities have come to Kazakhstan not on their own will, but were driven here by political repression and persecution. In Stalin’s times Kazakhstan hosted 1.5 million of political prisoners from Russia and other regions of the USSR. And more than 1.3 million of people were deported by Stalin regime during World War II years “as representatives of unreliable nations”. All these people found understanding and support of Kazakh people, found their second Motherland on the land of Kazakhstan.

      The principle of equality of all ethnic groups that inhabit our country is strictly adhered by. All conditions for a full national self-expression have been created as well as the rights for the fulfilment of their ethno cultural interests are ensured. Legal guarantees and respectful treatment of all the languages used in the republic defend the integral right of citizens of any nationality to develop their language and culture. Figures witness the balance and harmony of the national policy: about 40% of secondary schools use Russian language in teaching. The higher education for 70% is available in Russian language. In areas of residence of compact ethnic groups schools function with Uyghur, Tajik, Ukrainian, German, Polish and other languages of teaching.

      The Sunday schools of national and cultural unions also receive support in the teaching of native languages. Today 30 languages of ethnic groups of Kazakhstan are taught in about 200 Sunday schools and 3 schools of national revival. Magazines and newspapers are published, TV and radio programs are broadcast in 11 national language in Kazakhstan. Books in the languages of ethnic minorities of Kazakhstan are published annually on the state order with a total number exceeding 80 000. Besides Kazakh and Russian theatres there are also Uyghur, German and Korean ones.

      Ethnic cultural centres have been established in all areas of Kazakhstan, to support ethnic identity of different nationalities. Their highest forum is the Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. Today this powerful social force has become an organic part of the civil society and expresses its views in the chambers of the Parliament, political parties, mass-media, state and non-government organizations. The Assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan has become an important element of the political system of Kazakhstan. It has forged the interests of all the ethnos and ensures the rights and freedoms of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion. 27 republican and regional, more than 300 district ethnic cultural unions enter the Assembly of people of Kazakhstan. Three centres have an international status. The Assembly deals with 16 Small Regional Assemblies of peoples of Kazakhstan which act as consultative bodies by the regional administrations and comprise representatives of local ethnic-cultural and social unions.

      Kazakhstan’s efforts to ensure inter-ethnic peace and accord are essential for internal stability and are widely recognized in the world. The Pope as well as UN General Secretary Koffi Annan who paid visits to our country over the last five years cited Kazakhstan as the example of inter-ethnic consent and sustainable development of a multi-ethnic society. The interethnic policy is based on the principle of unity in variety. The civil peace and consent in Kazakhstan are the result of a persistent policy of the Government which enjoys the support of the whole society.

          value: Many nationalities have come to Kazakhstan not on their own will,
            but were driven here by political repression and persecution. In Stalin’s
            times Kazakhstan hosted 1.5 million of political prisoners from Russia
            and other regions of the USSR. And more than 1.3 million of people were
            deported by Stalin regime during World War II years “as representatives
            of unreliable nations”. All these people found understanding and support
            of Kazakh people, found their second Motherland on the land of Kazakhstan.

            It has forged the interests of all the ethnos and ensures the rights and
            freedoms of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion.

            and comprise representatives of local ethnic-cultural and social unions.

            essential for internal stability and are widely recognized in the world.
            The Pope as well as UN General Secretary Koffi Annan who paid visits to
            our country over the last five years cited Kazakhstan as the example of
            inter-ethnic consent and sustainable development of a multi-ethnic society.
            The interethnic policy is based on the principle of unity in variety.
            The civil peace and consent in Kazakhstan are the result of a persistent
            policy of the Government which enjoys the support of the whole society.

    title: Horse Culture
    body: "Strong evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5919/1332\">Botai
      civilization</a> was the first to domesticate the horse. Research and analysis
      of escavated pottery and other artifacts has coalesced the opinion that the
      ancient inhabitants of what is modern-day Kazakhstan used horses to aid them
      with their day-to-day lives.  \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/horse-culture/\"
      width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n##
      Significance of the Horse in Kazakh Culture\n\nWhile the people of the Great
      Steppe had tamed horses thousands of years ago, the horse, its symbolism and
      history are woven into the fabric of Kazakh culture and modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\nThe
      world cultural community recognizes the unique and special role equines have
      in Kazakh culture. UNESCO has included the __traditional Spring Festive Rites
      of Kazakh horse breeders__ on the Representative List of the [Intangible Cultural
      Heritage (ICH) of Humanity](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-spring-festive-rites-of-the-kazakh-horse-breeders-01402).
      \n\nPreceded by year-long preparations, the the Spring Festive Rites of Kazakh
      Horse Breeders include: \n\n- __Biye baylau__ (tethering mares), the ancient
      first milking rite encompassing the separation of mares and foals from the herds,
      milking the mares and celebrating with songs, dances and games. \n- __Ayghyr
      kosu__ (the stallion’s marriage), a rite for adjoining stallions in herds to
      commence a new breeding season. \n- __Kymyz muryndyk__ the opening of the Spring
      season's Kymyz sharing rite and marks the season's production and sharing among
      other families. Kymyz, pronounced \"koumiss\", is a fermented mare's milk beverage.

      Sayis - National Horse Racing Games\n- __Kokpar__\nThis game consists of two
      teams of horse riders. The objective is for the team to gather a goat carcass
      and bring it to their part of the playing field, past a designated line. Each
      time tries to do this as many times as possible to gain points.\n- __Audaryspak__\n
      \ The objective of this game is quite simple: two horsemen must wrestle and
      attempt to push each other off of his saddle. \n- __Kyz kuu__ \n  In this game,
      a horseman tries to catch a girl on a horse galloping at full speed. He has
      to do this before she reaches the finish line. If he catches her, he may kiss
      her. But, if he loses, the girl must catch him and whip him (playfully, of course).\n-
      __Kumys-alu__\n  This game is quite easy to grasp, too. A horseman must gallop
      on his horse and attempt to pick up coins scattered on the ground. The rider
      gets to keep the coins he gathers as a prize.\n- __Tenge alu__ \n- __Zhaby atu__

    title: Holidays
    body: "### January 1-2 – New Year\n\n### March 8 – International Women’s Day\n\nIWD
      is a global day celebrating the economic, political and social achievements
      of women past, present, and future.\n\n### March 22 – Nauryz (Traditional holiday
      of Spring, ancient Turkic New Year)\n\n“Nauruz”, Persian for “New Year”, is
      a time for family and friends to celebrate, cherish the past memories, and anticipate
      a better year. To rejoice in the end of the harsh winter and welcome the spring,
      relatives gather around a table and exchange gifts. All who join in the festivities,
      however, must have accomplished the following goals:\n\n- Asked for forgiveness
      of their sins\n- Liquidated their debts\n- Revived themselves spiritually\n-
      Physically reconciled with relatives and friends.\n\nSimilar to the Persian
      New Year, the number ‘7’ is significant for Kazakhs. For instance, the main
      ritual dish, “Nauryz-kozheh,” includes seven ingredients:\n\n- Water\n- Meat\n-
      Salt\n- Fat\n- Flour\n- Cereal\n- Milk\n\nThese seven ingredients signify the
      seven life beginnings:\n\n- Joy\n- Luck\n- Wisdom\n- Health\n- Wealth\n- Speedy
      growth\n- Heavenly protection\n\nEveryone must visit seven houses and invite
      seven guests.\n\nDuring the day, Kazakhs shout, “Koktem tudy!” (Spring is born!)
      in the streets, squares, parks and stadiums. There are plenty of activities
      to participate in or observe, including:\n\n- Horse-racing\n- Kazakhsha-kyres
      (national sport in which men wrestle while riding a horse)\n- Kokpar (team contest
      of rider groups trying to seize and take possession of a slaughtered goat’s
      body)\n- Ethnic theater\n- Fashion shows\n- Parades (marches that teach visitors
      about the Kazakh culture and the importance of respecting other countries).\n-
      Nauryz concert 2011\n\n### May 1 – Unity Day\n\nThis day marks the anniversary
      of the meeting held in 1726 between three local Kazak elders (biis), Tole Bi,
      Kazybek Bi, and Aiteke Bi. Fearing the threat of invading Dzhungars, the three
      sought to reunite their hordes to create a stronger, more effective defense.
      President Nazarbayev has indicated that the success of these men in uniting
      the Kyrgyz and Uzbek tribes should inspire the process of establishing peace
      in Central Asia.\n\nIn today’s world, Unity day is celebrated as a form of Labor
      Day: a day of national, regional, and global solidarity. Within the borders
      of Kazakhstan, many associations, unions, and communities of ethnic groups exist
      peacefully, including but not limited to Poles, Romanians, Hungarians, Greeks.\n\n###
      May 9 – Victory Day\n\nCelebrated since 1947, Victory Day marks the surrender
      of Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union in World War II. It was first inaugurated
      in the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union, following the signing of the surrender
      document on May 9, 1945.\n\n### July 6 - Astana Day\n\nOn July 6 Kazakhs celebrate
      the \"birthday\" of their capital - Astana (Astana was renamed to Nur-Sultan
      in March 2019). \n\n### August 30 – Constitution Day\n\nConstitution Day is
      a public holiday honoring the day Kazakhstan signed and adopted their Constitution.\n\n###
      December 16 – Independence Day\n\nIn just a short span of time, Kazakhstan has
      managed to become a stable, powerful, and well-respected nation. In honor of
      the past 18 years of independence, celebrations will be held throughout the
      country, including concerts, conferences, exhibitions, and feasts."

    title: Literature
    body: "Abay Kunanbaev (1845-1904). Abay was born in 1845 at the bottom of the
      Chingiz Mountain in the today's Abai district (former Karkaraly) located in
      Eastern Kazakhstan region (formerly, the Semipalatinsk region).\n\nHe was a
      well-known Kazakh poet, a great thinker, composer, philosopher, the founder
      of written Kazakh literature, and its first classic.\n\nThe heritage he left
      his nation is rich in songs and poems, translations and prose. His translations
      of the poetry written by Russian writers and poets such as Pushkin, Lermontov,
      and Krylov became the national patrimony of Kazakhstan. He translated the works
      of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron into Kazakh language.\n\nAbai Kunanbaev is the
      Shakesphere of Kazakh literature.  His [Book of Words](http://kazakhworld.com/abai-kunanbaev-book-of-words/),
      «Kara Sozder», created by the great thinker constitute an ethnic philosophical
      work. This creation of his is an exploration of Kazakh national life in the
      second half of the 19th century. He influenced social affairs in the country
      where he lived.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/abai-slides/\"
      width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nHe also participated
      in the governing of the country and played a certain role in trying to solve
      complicated problems justly.\n\nThe name of Abai is known worldwide just as
      Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin are well-known in many countries, because his
      great words became a spiritual patrimony of not only one nation, but of the
      entire humankind.\n\nAbay's main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore
      lies in his poetry, which expresses great nationalism and grew out of Kazakh
      folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing the nomadic habits
      of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abay's lifetime, however, a number
      of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred. Russian influence
      continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational possibilities
      as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether Russian,
      Western or Asian. Abay Qunanbayuli steeped himself in the cultural and philosophical
      history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense, Abay's creative poetry
      affected the philosophical thinking of educated Kazakhs.\n\nThe leaders of the
      Alash Orda movement saw him as their inspiration and spiritual predecessor.\n\nContemporary
      Kazakh images of Abay generally depict him in full traditional dress holding
      a dombra (the Kazakh national instrument). Today, Kazakhs revere Abay as one
      of the first folk heroes to enter into the national consciousness of his people.
      Almaty State University is named after Abay, so is one of the main avenues in
      the city of Almaty. There are also public schools with his name.\n\nContent

These resulted in a specific climate and a peculiar natural system of the country, which seems to absorb the brightest examples of landscape of both continents. In addition, complicated history of Kazakh people and constant interaction of nomadic lifestyle with settled people in South Kazakhstani ancient cities, have lead to a unique and authentic culture of Kazakhstan.

      These peculiarities have created an opportunity to develop various and diverse offers for travel and tourism in Kazakhstan, which include authentic cultural tourism,nature-based activities, including ecotourism, birdwatching, etc. in national parks and protected areas, skiing or trekking in mountains, water sports, sunbathing andswimming in lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan, and many others.

      Diversity of natural areas has contributed to rich flora and fauna of Kazakhstan. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 species of birds and 107 species of fish; and over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves were established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.

      The most famous of them among tourists include Aksu Zhabagly Nature Reserve, which is a habitat of snow leopard and other rare animals, and is also known as a Kingdom of Tulips, where tulips are believed to originate, long before they were introduced in Holland; Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve is famous for its pink flamingos and other rare species of wildlife, and popular among bird-watchers; Altyn Emel National Park is interesting for its mystery of Singing Dune; Katon-Karagay National Park is a habitat of marals (red deers), unossified antlers of which are used as a precious medicine. 

      __Mountains: Trekking and winter sports__

      A range of high, middle and low mountains, such as Tien Shan, Altay, Ulytau, Kazygurt, etc. have a beautiful nature attracting tourists from all over the world. Tien Shan Mountains is the highest among them (with the highest peak of about 7000 metres), and Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, is located at its bottom. Thus, an easy access to marvelous landscapes for tourists interested in trekking and winter sports is available from Almaty city.

      Most popular climbing routes are located in the Small Almaty Valley and Bogdanovich Glacier. Attractions of these places include Pogrebetsky Glacier (4,231 meters), Tuyuc Su (4100 m), Ordzhonikidze (3980 m) peaks, and many others. In addition, high mountains of Kazakhstan are ideal for winter sports. There is no wonder that Kazakhstan hosted Winter Asian Games in 2011: one of the priorities of the country has been propaganda of winter sports.

      A unique sport complex Medeu (sometimes spelled as Medew or Medeo), with a skating rink popular among tourists, was built in 1950’s, at 1691 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest skating rink in the world. A sophisticated artificial refrigeration system enables to keep high quality ice coverage over 8-months of the year. Another major winter sport attraction of Kazakhstan is Shymbulak (Chimbulak) ski resort, also located not far from Almaty. Snow lies in these places from November till May; however, sunny weather is usually registered there during more than three hundred days each year. The resort hotel can accept up to 114 tourists. 

      __Lakes and rivers: water sports, sunbathing and health resorts__

      Kazakhstan is not only steppes and mountains; it is also a country of rivers and lakes. Lakes among the steppes are usually like an oasis among empty deserts.
      Coast of the biggest lake in the world – Caspian Sea is perfect for sunbathing, swimming and fishing. The largest number of reservoirs is concentrated in the south-east part of the country, in the region with a symbolic name Zhetysu - “Seven Rivers”. Almost all the rivers of Zhetysu belong to the basin of Lake Balkhash, which is also a popular tourist destination for its health centres and recreation camps. Besides health resorts, rafting in mountain rivers for extreme tourists, boating and sailing in lakes are only a few examples of activities offered for tourists in Kazakhstan.

      __Culture: ethnotourism__

      Unique culture of Kazakhstan is a reason to travel to Kazakhstan for many tourists. Almost in every corner of the republic, a visitor, interested in real life of Kazakh people - their traditions, rituals, art and culture, will find many things of interest. These include museum complexes, ethno villages, depicting traditional lifestyle of Kazakh people, historical sites of medieval cities and many others.

      For example, tourists are offered to experience traditional lifestyle of Kazakhs, to try national dishes and to interact with the local people in Shabanbay Bi Village, situated in Kyzylaray Mountains, Central Kazakhstan. Zhambyl Zhabayev museum complex in Almaty region includes a house with a garden, where the poet lived in XIX-XX centuries and a mausoleum. This is a visual representation of not only Zhambyl’s life, but also of a whole era in which the poet lived and worked. South Kazakhstan is famous for ancient cities located at the routes of the Great Silk Road with historical monuments and other sites.

      Ethno-memorial complex Map of Kazakhstan - Atameken, located in Astana, is the largest ethnographic park in Kazakhstan and a unique outdoor museum. Cities and landscapes of the country, as well as mini copies of main attractions and historical sites can be found on the map.

      title: Nur-Sultan
      body: "Nur-Sultan is located in the center of Kazakhstan in the dry steppe zone
        and in the grass steppe subzone. The area of the city stands above the flood
        plain. The Yessil River is a major waterway of the capital. The city has an
        extreme continental climate with cold winter and hot dry summer.\n\nNur-Sultan
        hosted the 2017 world's fair, Astana Expo 2017. The theme of the Astana Expo
        2017 is \"Future Energy\". \n\nNur-Sultan’s favourable location in the centre
        of the Eurasian continent makes it an economically advantageous transport,
        communication and logistics centre, and a natural bridge between Europe and
        Asia.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yrqt_3Po2LE\"
        frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
        picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe transfer of the capital
        to Nur-Sultan gave a powerful impetus to its economic development. The city’s
        high economic growth rates attract numerous investors. The share of Nur-Sultan
        in the overall volume of investments attracted to Kazakhstan accounts for
        10 percent, while the Gross Regional Product of the city amounts to 10.2 percent.\n\nThe
        city has become one of the largest business centres in Kazakhstan. \n\nEntrepreneurship
        is rapidly developing in Nur-Sultan. Today there are more than 128,000 small
        and medium enterprises in the city. \n\nNur-Sultan is among the leading cities
        of the country in terms of the volume of construction. After the city became
        the capital of Kazakhstan, 10 million square metres of housing facilities
        have been built. Hundreds of companies from Kazakhstan and abroad took part
        in the construction of Nur-Sultan.\n\nThe architectural concept of Nur-Sultan
        was based on the idea of Nursultan Nazarbayev implying a special Eurasian
        style of Nur-Sultan should harmoniously combine the cultural traditions of
        both the East and the West. A well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa
        became the author of the general layout of the capital city.\n\nToday Nur-Sultan,
        located in the heart of Eurasia, is a venue for numerous international forums,
        congresses and large scale international events. The Congress of Leaders of
        World and Traditional Religions, the Astana Economic Forum and other forums
        are held regularly in the city. In December, 2010, the historical Summit of
        the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe took place in the
        capital city of Kazakhstan, after which it hosted the anniversary summits
        of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
        In early 2011, the city welcomed the participants and guests of the 7th Asian
        Winter Games. In 2017, Nur-Sultan hosted the international specialized exhibition
        EXPO-2017.\n\nThe Akmolinsk outer military district was founded in 1832 on
        the banks of the Esil River, in the Qaraotkel woods. Until 1961, the name
        of this town was Akmolinsk (Aqmola in Kazakh), and because of its ideal location,
        it soon turned into a central point for trade livestock fairs. In 1961, the
        name was changed to Tselinograd, then to Aqmola in 1992. Astana was not the
        official name until 1998. In 2019, the capital was renamed to Nur-Sultan after
        the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n### Expat's Nur-Sultan\n\n__Facts__\n\n-
        In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s area was over 300 sq. km., but today, the city boundaries
        are rapidly expanding.\n- The distance between Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the
        former capital, is 1,318 km.\n- In 1998, Nur-Sultan’s population was about
        300,000. This year (2009), the population has reached 700,000.\n\n__New Capital__\n\nIn
        1997, the President of Kazakhstan made the decision to relocate the capital
        of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Akmola city (Nur-Sultan) for the following reasons:\n\n-
        Advantageous geopolitical location\n- Considerable industrial potential\n-
        Crucial resources for subsequent development of the construction industry\n-
        Location in the largest transport junction\n- Essential transport and telecommunication
        infrastructure\n- Highly skilled urban workforce\n- Large private sector\n-
        Potentialities for entrepreneurship development\n- Political and social stability\n-
        Free land for further urban development.\n\nThe most important reason for
        moving the capital and expanding and improving the city of Nur-Sultan was
        to represent the new face and image of a modern, economically stable and prosperous, democratically
        viable Kazakhstan.\n\n__City of the Future__\n\nAt Nur-Sultan’s historical
        inauguration ceremony, the President declared, “From now on any major decisions
        important for the future of the people will be made here in the centre of
        this colossal country. Now the heart of our motherland is beating here. Kazakhstan
        is making and defining its history and destiny here and today.”\n\nIn 1998,
        the decision was made to officially change the name of the new capital Akmola
        to Astana, (“capital” in Kazakh). A year later, the Astana from waterUnited
        Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) granted
        the status, “City of Peace,” to Astana.\n\nThe city’s rapid growth as the
        administrative and business center of the country matches the original concept
        for social and economic development. The theme of this concept is “The blossoming
        of Astana is the blossoming of Kazakhstan.”\n\n__More than 200 joint ventures
        and foreign companies are operating in the capital, including those belonging
        to:__\n\n- Turkey\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Kyrgyzstan\n- Switzerland.\n \nAstana
        is a member of the International Association of Capitals and Cultural Cities
        of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); it also has close bilateral
        relations with 13 cities and regions of the CIS.\n\n__The growth of Astana,
        as a result of it becoming the new capital, has had a powerful influence on
        neighboring industrial regions, such as:__\n\n- Karagandy\n- Pavlodar\n- East
        Kazakhstan\n- Kostanay\n\nThe move has also supported the development of entrepreneurship
        and businesses which will, in turn, lead to the opening of foreign companies,
        firms, and major bank branches within the city of Astana.\n\n__Business Magnet__\n\nAstana
        is a major center of activity and the hub of national and international transport
        links. The extensive traffic is mainly due to strong economic ties between:\n\n-
        South and Central Kazakhstan\n- Western Siberia and the Ural region\n- The
        Volga region and Central Russia.\n\nConstruction and the business of government
        have spurred investments in the local economy as well. Between 2000 and 2004,
        the number of new legal entities registered in the capital more than doubled,
        and the local housing stock nearly tripled in size. \n\n__The centers of the
        capital city’s economic activity are:__\n\n- Construction\n- The food industry\n-
        Tourism\n\nThe city boasts a growing number of restaurants and hotels that
        cater to business travelers. Major exhibition centers and universities, such
        as the L. Gumilyov Eurasian University, can be found within Astana. The A.
        Barayev Research Institute of Grain Farming is another establishment, not
        only famous in Kazakhstan but within the scientific world. In addition to
        the three museums, Astana also has branches of the Union of Writers and Artists
        of Kazakhstan, with over 40 newspapers and two literary magazines being published
        in the city.\n\n__Tourist Attractions__\n\n__Astana’s tourist attractions

        culture museum\n- The world’s most inland aquarium\n- A 10,000-seat skating
        stadium and cycle track.\n\nAdditionally, Astana is fast becoming a mecca
        for sports tourism; new sport centers are planned for the neighboring areas
        of Korgalzhyn and Ereimentau.\n\n__Culture and the Arts__\n\nThe Presidential
        Cultural Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established in the center
        of Astana. The structure of the Center includes a museum Cultural Centerwith
        various rooms and displays representing Kazakhstan’s past and present values.
        In addition, the Center has a library containing more than a million books
        and electronic catalogues.\n\nThe Kazakh National Music Academy has also been
        established in Astana. This Academy combines specialized and general musical
        education into one school. The Academy is a member of the European Association
        of Conservatories, Academies and Musical High Schools.\n\n__Spectators enjoy

        in the tradition of international cinemas and has become a favorite of the
        people of Astana.\n\n__Eighth Wonder of the World__\n\nIn September 2006,
        the inauguration of the Palace of Peace and Accord (62 meters in height),
        also known as the Peace Pyramid, marked another milestone in Astana’s evolution
        and may well become the Eighth Wonder of the World. Built to house the Assembly
        of Nations of Kazakhstan, a university, a museum, a library and a winter garden,
        the pyramid was designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster, who is famous
        for his futuristic glass roof on the German Parliament, the Reichstag.\n\n__Special
        Economic Zone__\n\nConstruction of the new city developments on left bank
        of the Esil River has started. To aid in this process, the Special Economic
        Zone (SEZ), providing more favorable conditions for investment, has been created.
        According to the General Development Plan of the Capital, the integrated structure
        of this complex, located on the left bank, will symbolize the new capital.\n\n__The
        creation of the SEZ will provide many benefits to both the state and potential
        investors, including:__\n\n- State support of direct investments into construction
        of Astana city\n- Significant tax privileges and preferentials\n- Opportunities
        to introduce modern technologies and scientific achievements in the field

        in the juridical regime of the SEZ or its liquidation before the appointed
        time, including the extension of the area. \n\nThe Customs regulation in the
        territory of the SEZ is applied in accordance to the customs legislature of
        Republic of Kazakhstan. The territory of the SEZ is considered to be a part

            value: Nur-Sultan lies in the northern part of Central Kazakhstan. Its
              territory is approximately 96,800 sq. km. The surrounding landscape
              is far from uniform, as hills intermingle with low mountains, plains,
              and river valleys. In the North is found the Kokshetau summit; in the
              southern and south-eastern portions of the region is the Saryarka, part
              of the Kazakh topography; and plains compose the North-East.

        To promote tourism, Kazakhstan enforced a “Law on Tourism” (1992) that embraces virtually all types of tourism. __The law also addresses key issues of tourism activities:__

        - Legal
        - Economic
        - Social
        - Organizational

        In addition to this law, the Government has adopted several enactments concerning tourism concerns, including a number of documents that regulate the licensing of tourism activities. In 1993, the National Program for developing Kazakhstan’s tourism industry was adopted, and in 1997, the Government passed the State Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, designed to accomplish the following goals:

        - Regenerate historic centers of the Great Silk Route
        - Preserve and development the cultural legacy of Turkic-speaking states
        - Create the tourism infrastructure from 1997-2003.

        Additionally, Kazakhstan became a member of the World Tourism Organization in 1993.
        The Committee for Regulation of Trade and Tourist Activity, a branch of the Ministry for Industry and Trade, is the body that manages tourism in Kazakhstan. Certain executive departments and tourism representatives from other countries carry out the administration of this committee.

        In 1997, Kazakhstan created the Strategy of tourism development, intended to be intact through 2030. Today, 430 tourism agencies, firms, and bureaus of various property forms function effectively in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They employ nearly 6,000 people and 1,500 professional guides. Kazakhstan tourism firms cooperate with almost 80 countries of the world; approximately 25 tourism firms in Almaty and five in regional centers arrange charter flights to the following countries:

        - India
        - Turkey
        - The United Arab Emirates
        - Pakistan
        - South Korea
        - Greece
        - Poland.

        There are also cooperative agreements with the following places:

        - Turkey
        - Iran,
        - The Xinjang Uigur Autonomous Area of China
        - Moldova
        - Hungary
        - The State of Israel
        - Kyrghyzstan
        - Egypt

        In addition to those already in place, Kazakhstan is in the process of making intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements with other nations, including:

        - Croatia
        - Pakistan
        - Singapore

        Kazakhstan has experienced a significant increase in United Kingdom tourists over the past few years, and with the recent visa simplification procedures (letters of invitation are no longer required of EU and US citizens) still greater numbers are expected.

  title: Sherman House
  body: |
    ![sherman-house](//images.ctfassets.net/3u75lz35gn9w/1YvDc7vQJ0OFa5WFa0mJkP/b16c92ec8f42e8b35f8b7035f11baae3/sherman-house.png)
    Built in 1888, Washington, D.C.’s “Sherman House,” is home today to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the United States.  The spacious, brick, Richardsonian-style house has had some notable tenants, but none more so than __U.S. Vice President James S. Sherman__, the 27th Vice President of the United States. Sherman served as President William Howard Taft’s vice president and remains the only vice president ever to have died in office.

    ![James Sherman-651x814](//images.ctfassets.net/3u75lz35gn9w/2n1mS5uUlKV16Kfujtb7Wp/0d09096a128ef390b3923c81aefeace9/James_Sherman-651x814.png)

    The Sherman House features a massive hip roof, prominent chimneys and a distinctive round corner tower. The house was designed and built by Charles and Samuel Edmonston for Susan Shields, the widow of a wealthy newspaper publisher. The Edmonston’s familiar design style is reflected in many of the Dupont Circle neighborhood’s most enduring apartments and homes.

    To honor the Sherman tradition of open-door hospitality, diplomats fromKazakhstan go to great lengths welcome and entertain official visitors as well as the general public, who are always welcome to tour the inside of the house. Not only is the exterior of the Embassy wonderful, but the inside is well-appointed with rich, dark woodwork, high ceilings and ornate staircases. The Embassy is much like the country itself in that it welcomes anyone through its door and visitors can view the Kazakh artwork, jewelry, statues, and cultural attire on display inside, including a room designed to resemble the interior of a traditional Kazakh yurt, or nomadic tent.

    The “Sherman House” is a small slice of American history. Since its construction, the house has served as a place of fellowship, dialogue and the open exchange of ideas. Appropriately, Kazakhstan’s modern day diplomats have embraced Sherman’s open-door policy to and used it to strengthen relations between Kazakhstan and the United States.

    For a tour of the Sherman House, please schedule your visit by sending a tweet to __@kazakhembassy__ or posting to the [Embassy of Kazakhstan in Washington, D.C.’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Embassy-of-Kazakhstan-in-Washington-DC/151137401613963?fref=ts).

          a distinctive round corner tower. The house was designed and built by Charles
          and Samuel Edmonston for Susan Shields, the widow of a wealthy newspaper
          publisher. The Edmonston’s familiar design style is reflected in many of
          the Dupont Circle neighborhood’s most enduring apartments and homes.

          anyone through its door and visitors can view the Kazakh artwork, jewelry,
          statues, and cultural attire on display inside, including a room designed
          to resemble the interior of a traditional Kazakh yurt, or nomadic tent.

    title: Strategic Partnership Dialogue
    body: "Kazakhstan and the United States in 2010 launched the __Annual Bilateral
      Consultations__ (ABC) under Strategic Partnership – a framework for cooperation
      on range of issues including regional cooperation, stabilization of Afghanistan,
      security, democratic reform, rule of law, human rights, civil society development,
      economic development, energy, science and technology, and people to people contacts.
      \n\nKazakhstan and the United States elevated cooperation to the framework of
      an __Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue__ during President Nursultan Nazarbayev's
      visit to the US in January 2018. During their meeting on January 16, 2018 President
      Nazarbayev and President Trump committed to an [Enhanced Strategic Partnership
      for the 21st Century](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-kazakhstan-enhanced-strategic-partnership-21st-century/).\n\nThe
      first meeting of Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue was held on December
      8-12, 2018 in Nur-Sultan [during the visit](http://mfa.gov.kz/en/content-view/kazahstansko-amerikanskoe-sotrudnicestvo-obsuzdeno-v-astane)
      of the US delegation led by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau
      of South and Central Asian Affairs, Ambassador Alice Wells.\n\nIn 2013, Washington
      hosted the second SPD meeting where the two sides recognized that significant
      progress had been made in the bilateral relationship since the inaugural meeting
      in 2012. \n\nThe third SPD took place when Foreign Minister Idrissov and Secretary
      Kerry met on December 10, 2014 in Washington, D.C. The two sides highlighted
      the robust and growing bilateral ties between Kazakhstan and the United States
      and reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen the strategic partnership.
      The United States expressed its unwavering support for Kazakhstan’s independence,
      sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The joint statement on the third SPD
      highlighted Kazakhstan and U.S. partnership on global issues such as counterterrorism
      and peace-building, recognized Kazakhstan's role as neutral host of the P5+1
      talks with Iran and contribution to the UN ebola response fund. \n\nThe U.S.
      also welcomed Kazakhstan's hosting of the fifth Congress of Leaders of World
      and Traditional Religions, June 10-11, 2015, in Nur-Sultan. The joint statement
      affirmed U.S. - Kazakh cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation and security,
      and democracy and civil society strengthening. The U.S. welcomed Kazakhstan's
      human rights progress, particularly the Consultative and Advisory Body Dialogue
      Platform on Human Dimension.\nThe first session of the fourth SPD was held on
      November 2, 2015, when Secretary Kerry visited Nur-Sultan. The sides discussed
      counter-terrorism measures, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and regional security.
      The next session of the fourth SPD was in Washington, D.C. on March 9, 2016.\n\nThe
      fifth SPD took place on September 20, 2016 in New York City, on the margins
      of the 71st United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister Idrissov and Secretary
      Kerry assessed that the strategic partnership between the two countries has
      never been stronger.\n\nThe ESPD convened most [recently](http://mfa.gov.kz/en/content-view/-1825
      \"ECPD between Kazakhstan and the United States was discussed in Washington,
      D.C\") on December 4, 2019 in Washington, D.C., and preceeded a visit by Foreign
      Minister Tileuberdi.  \n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p

    title: Democracy, Human Rights & Rule of Law
    body: |-
      Kazakhstan rule of law initiatives are points of partnership with the United States and European Union. The US has introduced the American Corners program to promote American culture and the English language. Under the program, the US has opened educational centers located in the cities of Almaty, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Karaganda, Shymkent, Uralsk, Atyrau, Petropavlovsk and Aktobe. With the US government help Kazakhstan has developed a robust network of civil society organizations that provide important services to the population, advocate the constituent rights and engage on key policy reform issues. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) works with local organizations to promote human rights, media developments, legal reforms, and women’s rights.

      Kazakhstan cooperates with the United States on initiatives to protect human rights and religious freedom at home and abroad. One of the platforms for effective dialogue is the [Annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom](https://www.state.gov/ministerial-to-advance-religious-freedom/) hosted by the U.S. Secretary of State. The [1st inaugural Ministerial](https://blogs.state.gov/stories/2018/07/27/en/united-states-hosts-first-ever-ministerial-advance-international-religious) was held on July 24-26, 2018. The 2nd Ministerial took place in Washington, D.C. on July 16-18, 2019. The Kazakh delegation was led by Minister of Information and Social Development, Mr Dauren Abayev.

  title: Economic Cooperation
  body: "Kazakhstan has attracted significant foreign investment since independence.
    The U.S. is one of Kazakhstan's most important economic partners. Bilateral cooperation
    is affirmed by one-on-one meetings between presidents. Most recently Presidents
    Trump and Tokayev meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September
    2019, and then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev visited the White House in January
    2018. There exists bilateral resolve to strengthen cooperation in trade and investment,
    security and people-to-people relationships within the framework of an [Enhanced
    Strategic Partnership Dialogue](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-kazakhstan-enhanced-strategic-partnership-21st-century/).
    Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was sworn in as the new President of Kazakhstan on
    March 20, 2019, reaffirmed his commitment to continue the country's foreign and
    economic policy. \n\n<div class=\"usa-alert usa-alert-info\" >\n  <div class=\"usa-alert-body\">\n

    on *Economic Cooperation* was held in Washington Oct. 18 between commissions led
    by Kazakh Minister of Trade and Integration\nBakhyt Sultanov and U.S. Secretary
    of Commerce Wilbur Ross. The meeting was carried out in accordance with the commitments
    reached between First President of Kazakhstan - Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev and
    U.S. President Donald Trump during the former’s official visit to Washington in
    January 2018, as well as business meetings with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart
    Tokayev in New York in September 2019. \n\nThe parties reaffirmed their commitment
    to deepen the countries’ expanded strategic partnership, noting the growth in
    mutual trade and investment. Sultanov also noted significant potential for increasing
    Kazakh exports. At present, 50 items worth approximately $1 billion can additionally
    be delivered to the American market. The agenda included interaction issues within
    mechanisms including the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and Organisation for Economic
    Co-operation and Development (OECD). The co-chairs also noted the need to use
    the mutually beneficial capabilities of the U.S. Corporation for International
    Development Financing and Astana International Financial Centre.  "

    title: Trade & Commerce
    body: "Kazakhstan is the most efficient and investment-friendly transit hub for
      the greater Eurasia region. By 2020 the country aims to become a key logistics
      hub for Eurasia and beyond by developing transportation and export centers on
      the territory. Kazakhstan and the US have established a robust trade relationship
      that has generated skilled jobs in both countries. Kazakhstan imports annully
      from the U.S. high tech medical equipment, industrial machinery and livestock.
      \n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\"
      src=\"https://us-exports-kz.glitch.me\" style=\"max-width:100% height:auto\"></iframe>\n</div>\n
      \n__Proximity to Large Markets and Market Capacity__\n\nKazakhstan is the most
      efficient and investment-friendly transit hub for the greater Eurasia region.
      By 2020 the country aims to become a key logistics hub for Eurasia and beyond
      by developing transportation and export centers on the territory. Kazakhstan
      is setting up the __Western Europe - Western China International Transportation
      Corridor__, which will cut ground transportation time from China to Europe in
      third (from 30 to 10 days) and multiply the transit cargo volume by 1,000%,
      to 170 million tons from the current 16 million tons, allowing the country to
      jump from the 86th spot on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index to 40th
      place. This will increase Kazakhstan’s GDP by 68% above a 2010 baseline while
      also boosting the GDP of neighboring countries by 43%, providing an additional
      boost to Kazakhstan’s export economy. Kazakhstan’s integration into the EEU
      has already reduced border crossing times and gives Kazakhstan access to a wider
      market of more than 171 million people with $2.7 trillion annual GDP.\n\n__Kazakhstan
      is the Eurasian Hub __\n\nThe continental bridge for goods that move from East
      and West, South to North. By 2020 the country aims to become a key transit hub
      for Eurasia and beyond by developing transportation, logistics, and export centers
      on the territory and neighboring foreign countries. Kazakhstan is setting up
      the Western Europe - Western China International Transportation Corridor, which
      will cut the transportation time from China to Europe in third (from 30 to 10
      days), will multiply the transit cargo volume by 1,000 percent, to 170mil tons
      from the current 16mil, allowing the country to jump from the current 86th spot
      on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index to 40th place by increasing
      cargo transport. This will increase Kazakhstan’s GDP by 68 per cent above the
      2010 baseline, while boosting the GDP of neighboring countries by 43 per cent.
      Kazakhstan’s integration into the customs union with Russia and Belarus, which
      took full effect in January 2012, has cut border-crossing time in half and significantly
      reduced pilferage. The deeper integration under the umbrella of the __Eurasian
      Economic Union__ (EEU) promises to further reduce transportation costs and transaction
      costs.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/infographics/nasdaq-aifc.png\"
      style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n\nEEU builds on the successes
      of the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market
      for more than 171 million people with $2.7tn annual GDP. The objective of the
      union is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish a common
      energy market, and enable the free movement of people within the community.
      With the current size of 76.8mil people, the middle class accounts for around
      30 per cent of total population in Kazakhstan and more than 55 per cent in Russia.
      Both are both growing at an annual rate of 7 per cent, which makes both of them
      attractive for importation of consumer goods. Russia is the 6th biggest middle
      class consumer in the world.\n\nFor many investors Kazakhstan is a great springboard
      for expanding not only into the member countries of EEU but also the entire
      Central Asian region. It shares borders with all the other Central Asian countries
      and lies close to the Caucasus region. Central Asia and Caucasus offer a combined
      disposable income of over $260 billion.\nProjects in the transportation and
      energy sectors supported by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)
      Program will give additional impetus to the development of intra-regional trade
      relations as well as connectivity with China and Europe. "

      title: Eurasian Economic Union
      body: |-
        The Eurasian Economic Union represents the opening of new economic opportunities without sacrificing political independence. The EEU builds on the economic success of the Customs Union, and the EEU is in line with Kazakhstan's multi-vector foreign policy. Kazakhstan unequivocally maintains the EEU will not erode the country's political independence, which is critical to Kazakhstan’s priorities and multi-vector orientation. The EEU in its final form serves to advance Kazakhstan’s economic integration with the European Union, the United States, China and Latin America.

        ### Facts about the EEU:

        - The EEU builds on the Customs Union (CU) and Common Economic Space (CES) to establish a market with the total GDP of $1.9 TN. The Member-States of the Eurasian Economic Union are the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation. The objective of the union is to form a legal framework for a united economic zone, establish a common energy market, and enable the free movement of people within the community.
        - The EEU is an economic, not political union. It will not have any supra-national authority, over the sovereign states. Kazakhstan has made it clear that it will not support any supra-national political bodies, such as an EEU Parliament.
        - No country will dominate the decision-making process in the Union as each country has an equal vote as well as the right to veto. Resolutions will be based on the ruling of the majority.
        - As in the case of the EU, the member countries have various predispositions and concerns reflecting their endowments and power. Kazakh officials favor an economic association (much like UK’s disposition to the EU) while Belarus and Russia support stronger and deeper political and economic union (much like Germany). Given Kazakhstan’s insistence that EEU will not go beyond economic union, it is unlikely that integration will proceed further than the currently agreed-to format.
        - The Union is created to facilitate trade, both inside of the Union and with outside economies – not to act as a barrier to trade.
        - As a result of the creation of a new business environment and conditions for interaction between different businesses, all countries will see structural benefits that manifest themselves in the use of workforce, production and infrastructural cooperation and mutual investments. According to analysts, this will generate up to 25 per cent growth in member states by 2030 (15 years after the creation of the economic space), or around $600bn.

      title: WTO Accession
      body: |-
        Accession to the WTO has been a foreign policy priority for Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991. Kazakhstan gained WTO membership in 2015.  Kazakhstan worked to create the Eurasian Economic Union prior to WTO membership, which is viewed as a practical realization of the Kazakh President’s idea concerning the economic integration of Eurasian countries similar to the European Union announced by him in the mid-1990s.

        It is well known that a unified customs territory is an integral step towards that high level of economic integration. Neither in negotiations on the WTO, nor in negotiations on the Customs Union did Kazakhstan ever renounce its interests, and the country considers both processes to be mutually complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Therefore, the processes of Eurasian integration and WTO accession have always been in parallel.

        __WTO advances Kazakhstan’s Economic Interests__

        Kazakhstan's goal is further strengthening integration among global economies, and facilitate trade and investment freely among WTO countries.  Elimination of internal customs borders and harmonization of legislation of the WTO members is already creating additional benefits for the trading partners by insuring free circulation of goods between the Eurasian countries and thus, providing traders and investors with bigger economic space and more attractive market for potential investors.
        Kazakhstan's Regional Trade Agreements

        Kazakhstan’s decision on creating the EEU with Russia and Belarus was based solely on the country’s own economic interests including the following factors:

        - __Mineral Reserves.__ Kazakhstan has the sixth largest mineral reserves in the world and is a major player in the energy markets. A major portion of mineral and energy resources produced in Kazakhstan is exported to external markets. One of the main tasks of the Government of Kazakhstan is development of nonextractive sectors and diversification of the economy and export promotion of highly marketable products. A unified customs tariff within the Customs Union would expand the regional market and promote Kazakhstan’s exports. Future customs tariff policy within the Customs Union will allow the import of raw materials and equipment under low custom duties within the development of investment projects. Establishment of the Customs Union would entail creation of a unified commodity market with a total GDP of about $2 trillion (2008) and a population of 180 million people, as well as create preferential conditions within the Customs Union. Such a large market within a unified customs territory would make Kazakhstan even more attractive for foreign investors who have considered Kazakhstan as one of the most attractive markets in our part of the world.
        - __Geopolitical Realities.__ Kazakhstan is the largest land-locked country in the world and much of its foreign trade depends on the routes that go through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the Customs Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory) transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading relations, particularly with the European Union, are implemented through the transit of the territory of Russia.
        - __Global Financial Crisis.__ The crisis has thinned down the flow of FDIs, decreased trade turnover, led to the introduction of protectionist mechanisms by some trade partners, and seriously damaged the economies of neighboring states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more active and joint approach to further integrate and modernize the regional economy. Creation of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient use of the limited financial resources due to the global economic crisis. It will also provide a rationale for companies to use available resources to increase their production capacity.

        WTO accession provides sizable benefits for Kazakhstan and serves its long-term economic priorities. The decision was based on the need to meet Kazakhstan’s national economic interests including:

        - Unimpeded access to global markets
        - Expanding trade with large neighboring economies, such as Russia and China
        - Accelerated economic diversification by moving towards service and technology based economy.

        Therefore, any speculations suggesting political motivation behind the decision are baseless.

        __WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel__

        As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

        Kazakhstan’s team reassured American counterparts that the accession to the WTO has always been top priority for Kazakhstan’s foreign policy. The United States welcomes progress achieved by Kazakhstan in bringing its legislation in compliance with the WTO rules and supports its continuous trade liberalization process. In particular, such issues as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property rights and veterinary certificates are at the final stage of negotiations.

        Kazakhstan has finalized negotiations with the Unites States on Goods market access. Minister of Economic Development and Trade Zhanar Aitzhanova signed a document with U.S. Representative to the WTO Michael Punke in Geneva.

              ever renounce its interests, and the country considers both processes
              to be mutually complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Therefore,
              the processes of Eurasian integration and WTO accession have always
              been in parallel.

              Kazakhstan's goal is further strengthening integration among global economies, and facilitate trade and investment freely among WTO countries.  Elimination of internal customs borders and harmonization of legislation of the WTO members is already creating additional benefits for the trading partners by insuring free circulation of goods between the Eurasian countries and thus, providing traders and investors with bigger economic space and more attractive market for potential investors.

              in the world and is a major player in the energy markets. A major portion
              of mineral and energy resources produced in Kazakhstan is exported to
              external markets. One of the main tasks of the Government of Kazakhstan
              is development of nonextractive sectors and diversification of the economy
              and export promotion of highly marketable products. A unified customs
              tariff within the Customs Union would expand the regional market and
              promote Kazakhstan’s exports. Future customs tariff policy within the
              Customs Union will allow the import of raw materials and equipment under
              low custom duties within the development of investment projects. Establishment
              of the Customs Union would entail creation of a unified commodity market
              with a total GDP of about $2 trillion (2008) and a population of 180
              million people, as well as create preferential conditions within the
              Customs Union. Such a large market within a unified customs territory
              would make Kazakhstan even more attractive for foreign investors who
              have considered Kazakhstan as one of the most attractive markets in
              our part of the world.

              go through the territories of neighboring states. Membership in the
              Customs Union will provide Kazakhstan’s businesses with domestic (non-discriminatory)
              transit tariffs, taking into consideration that almost all the trading
              relations, particularly with the European Union, are implemented through
              the transit of the territory of Russia.

              of neighboring states. This harsh reality, therefore, demanded a more
              active and joint approach to further integrate and modernize the regional
              economy. Creation of the Customs Union will allow for more efficient
              use of the limited financial resources due to the global economic crisis.
              It will also provide a rationale for companies to use available resources
              to increase their production capacity.

              WTO and EEU Negotiations Moved in Parallel
              As mentioned earlier, negotiations on Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and efforts to join the Customs Union were moving in parallel. The idea of establishing a single customs territory was initiated earlier and had been moving at a much better pace, which was in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s economic interests. The process of harmonizing tariffs within the creation of the Customs Union demanded flexibility from every member and a transition period was introduced for some major commodities sensitive for Kazakhstan. It is also important to understand that the pace for creating the Customs Union has been, to a large extent, dependent on the political will from the Governments of the three states. Therefore, promotion of trade and economic cooperation with the neighboring countries has become the most important priority.

      title: Astana International Finance Centre
      body: |-
        Kazakhstan enters a new phase of the development after a period of high economic growth. The crisis of 2007-2009 was successfully overcome through the use of accumulated resources. Sovereign wealth funds, established in the previous years, played a major role in the economic development. With the falling prices for the country's main export commodities, new approaches to public policy are necessary. In particular, diversification of economy, better management of the accumulated funds and assets, as well as the development of a financial services market have become important. At the same time, the country's integration into regional cooperation organisations and the Eurasian Economic Union creates conditions for accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan into the global financial system. 

        Five institutional reforms of the Head of State and Hundred Concrete Steps Program to implement these reforms (hereinafter – Plan of the Nation) have become a new starting point in the development of Kazakhstan. As part of the Plan of the Nation, [Astana International Financial Centre](http://www.aifc.kz/) (hereinafter – AIFC) was established at the order of the President of Republic of Kazakhstan with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition (hereinafter – EXPO-2017) infrastructure. 

        A Constitutional Law providing favourable environment for the AIFC participants was passed for a successful launch of the AIFC. The main goal of AIFC, like of any other state reform, is to improve welfare of Kazakhstan residents. Various aspects of the AIFC shall allow improving the approaches to managing sovereign wealth funds and facilitating the transfer of foreign knowledge and technology to the country, thus, ensuring an increase and the development of human capital. The slowdown of business cycles in the country due to the deteriorating conditions in foreign markets and unfavourable geopolitical situation in the region, only justifies the need for a financial centre - it is important now more than ever to attract new investments in the financial capital, as well as in technology and human capital. The initiative to establish an international financial centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development. 

        In order to establish AIFC as a local centre of expertise with a developed capital market and later to develop it into a regional platform for financial intermediation, the strategy for the development of AIFC has been developed until 2021, inclusive. Implementing the initial phase of the development of the AIFC shall serve as a solid foundation for the realisation of the subsequent phases, namely, development into a regional financial centre, and eventually, into an international financial centre. The strategy for the development of AIFC shall be reviewed upon the implementation of each phase of the development due to a change of goals and objectives.

              centre with a high-tech infrastructure and a new institutional framework
              is one of the reforms aimed at the long-term development.

      first half of 2018 reached $2.79 billion, a 44.7 percent increase compared to
      the same period in 2017 ($1.93 billion). Overall, from 2005 to July 2018, the
      gross volume of American FDI to the Kazakh economy amounted to __$33.76 billion__.\n\nKazakhstan
      annually hosts various investment and trade-economic events, where the Kazakh
      government officials and business leaders present current and future investment
      opportunities open to US investment and establish frameworks for future cooperation
      with US businesses. \n\nA delegation of 16 major U.S. businesses visited Kazakhstan
      in October 2018 during the inaugural US Department of Commerce Certified Trade
      Mission to Kazakhstan [led by Secretary Wilbur Ross](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/business/us-secretary-of-commerce-heads-trade-mission-to-kazakhstan/50000265-3793059).

      States to support its leadership role in economic development efforts in the
      Central Asia region. \n\nTogether with Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan,
      Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan the countries established the United States-Central
      Asia Trade and Investment Framework (TIFA) in 2004. In 2014, at the 9th Council

      2017, the United States and Kazakhstan elevated their bilateral energy partnership
      to the level of the __Strategic Energy Dialogue__. This expanded format provides
      the basis for cooperation in the development of peaceful nuclear industry, technologies
      for carbon capture, storage and utilization, stability of energy networks, as
      well as nuclear safety and non-proliferation.\n\nIn January 2018, President
      Nursultan Nazarbayev met with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry and State Agency
      for Foreign Private Investment President Ray Washburn during his official visit
      to the US. The sides discussed Kazakhstan-US cooperation in the oil and gas
      sector and spoke about the implementation of projects at the Tengiz and Kashagan
      oilfields. President Nazarbayev also told Secretary Perry about the opening
      of the __Low-Enriched Uranium Bank__ in Kazakhstan.\n\nAt the 10th Annual Meeting
      of the Commission in 2014 the countries agreed to continue promoting cooperation
      in four broad areas- nuclear security, hydrocarbon resources, renewable energy
      and energy efficiency, and electric power. In the context of Kazakhstan’s plan
      to transition towards Green Economy, the countries have established a permanent
      expert dialogue and advanced implementation of renewable energy, energy efficiency,
      and clean energy projects. \n\nThe US has actively promoted diversification
      of pipeline export-routes in the Caspian Sea region, in order to increase the
      energy security of consumers in Europe and the Middle East and to diversify
      the market opportunities for Kazakhstani exporters. With American support, Kazakhstan
      signed an agreement with Azerbaijan in June 2006 to transport oil through the
      Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. For Kazakhstan, this agreement was necessary
      to safeguard its export markets due to Russia’s refusal to increase the transportation
      capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and the BTC’s capacity to
      handle increased production. \n\nSince 2006 Kazakhstan has been co-funding programs
      under USAID’s Economic Development Program jointly with USAID, demonstrating
      country’s interest in USAID’s expertise and support in developing small and
      medium enterprises, economic reforms, and regional trade. For the year 2014,
      programs targeting development of small businesses, foreign investment attraction
      and energy efficiency increase were allocated around $4.1 million. Kazakhstan
      received approximately $2 billion of all-agency funding from the US between
      1993 and 2012.\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev met with US Energy Secretary Rick
      Perry and State Agency for Foreign Private Investment President Ray Washburn
      on January 16, 2018 during his official visit to the US. The sides discussed

In 2003, Kazakhstan sent military engineers to assist operations of the U.S. coalition in Iraq. Over five years, nine contingents totaling 290 Kazakh peacekeeping troops were rotated through Iraq. The troops carried out various missions, including humanitarian assistance operations, convoy security, perimeter and base defense, quick reaction force duties, traffic control point operations, water purification, and demining. In fact, Kazakhstan's forces dismantled nearly five million mines and explosives during their tenure in the Iraq. Kazakh doctors, together with their Iraqi colleagues and counterparts from other countries, provided medical assistance to more than 500 Iraqis, as well.

      Kazakhstan hosts annual Steppe Eagle joint counter-terrorism and peacekeeping exercises between Kazakh, US and NATO forces. Steppe Eagle drills have been held in Kazakhstan every year except 2014 and 2018 since 2003. The 2018 exercises were held at McCrady Army National Guard Training Centre in South Carolina.

      After the completion of the Steppe Eagle 2018 exercises, Kazakhstan sent 120 peacekeepers to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in October 2018. The Kazakh soldiers were deployed in the Eastern part of the country along the border of Lebanon with Israel and Syria.

  title: Strategic Partnership Dialogue
  body: "Kazakhstan and the United States in 2010 launched the __Annual Bilateral
    Consultations__ (ABC) under Strategic Partnership – a framework for cooperation
    on range of issues including regional cooperation, stabilization of Afghanistan,
    security, democratic reform, rule of law, human rights, civil society development,
    economic development, energy, science and technology, and people to people contacts.
    \n\nKazakhstan and the United States elevated cooperation to the framework of
    an __Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue__ during President Nursultan Nazarbayev's
    visit to the US in January 2018. During their meeting on January 16, 2018 President
    Nazarbayev and President Trump committed to an [Enhanced Strategic Partnership
    for the 21st Century](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-kazakhstan-enhanced-strategic-partnership-21st-century/).\n\nThe
    first meeting of Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue was held on December
    8-12, 2018 in Nur-Sultan [during the visit](http://mfa.gov.kz/en/content-view/kazahstansko-amerikanskoe-sotrudnicestvo-obsuzdeno-v-astane)
    of the US delegation led by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau
    of South and Central Asian Affairs, Ambassador Alice Wells.\n\nIn 2013, Washington
    hosted the second SPD meeting where the two sides recognized that significant
    progress had been made in the bilateral relationship since the inaugural meeting
    in 2012. \n\nThe third SPD took place when Foreign Minister Idrissov and Secretary
    Kerry met on December 10, 2014 in Washington, D.C. The two sides highlighted the
    robust and growing bilateral ties between Kazakhstan and the United States and
    reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen the strategic partnership. The United
    States expressed its unwavering support for Kazakhstan’s independence, sovereignty,
    and territorial integrity. The joint statement on the third SPD highlighted Kazakhstan
    and U.S. partnership on global issues such as counterterrorism and peace-building,
    recognized Kazakhstan's role as neutral host of the P5+1 talks with Iran and contribution
    to the UN ebola response fund. \n\nThe U.S. also welcomed Kazakhstan's hosting
    of the fifth Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, June 10-11,
    2015, in Nur-Sultan. The joint statement affirmed U.S. - Kazakh cooperation on
    nuclear nonproliferation and security, and democracy and civil society strengthening.
    The U.S. welcomed Kazakhstan's human rights progress, particularly the Consultative
    and Advisory Body Dialogue Platform on Human Dimension.\nThe first session of
    the fourth SPD was held on November 2, 2015, when Secretary Kerry visited Nur-Sultan.
    The sides discussed counter-terrorism measures, the conflict in eastern Ukraine
    and regional security. The next session of the fourth SPD was in Washington, D.C.
    on March 9, 2016.\n\nThe fifth SPD took place on September 20, 2016 in New York
    City, on the margins of the 71st United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister
    Idrissov and Secretary Kerry assessed that the strategic partnership between the
    two countries has never been stronger.\n\nThe ESPD convened most [recently](http://mfa.gov.kz/en/content-view/-1825
    \"ECPD between Kazakhstan and the United States was discussed in Washington, D.C\")
    on December 4, 2019 in Washington, D.C., and preceeded a visit by Foreign Minister
    Tileuberdi.  \n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"

  title: Energy Partnership
  body: "The United States pays great attention to energy cooperation and has supported
    Kazakhstan in its efforts to increase its role in ensuring global energy security.
    __The Energy Partnership Commission__ that was established in 2003, plays an important
    role in coordinating energy cooperation between the countries. \n\nIn 2017, the
    United States and Kazakhstan elevated their bilateral energy partnership to the
    level of the __Strategic Energy Dialogue__. This expanded format provides the
    basis for cooperation in the development of peaceful nuclear industry, technologies
    for carbon capture, storage and utilization, stability of energy networks, as
    well as nuclear safety and non-proliferation.\n\nIn January 2018, President Nursultan
    Nazarbayev met with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry and State Agency for Foreign
    Private Investment President Ray Washburn during his official visit to the US.
    The sides discussed Kazakhstan-US cooperation in the oil and gas sector and spoke
    about the implementation of projects at the Tengiz and Kashagan oilfields. President
    Nazarbayev also told Secretary Perry about the opening of the __Low-Enriched Uranium
    Bank__ in Kazakhstan.\n\nAt the 10th Annual Meeting of the Commission in 2014
    the countries agreed to continue promoting cooperation in four broad areas- nuclear
    security, hydrocarbon resources, renewable energy and energy efficiency, and electric
    power. In the context of Kazakhstan’s plan to transition towards Green Economy,
    the countries have established a permanent expert dialogue and advanced implementation
    of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean energy projects. \n\nThe US
    has actively promoted diversification of pipeline export-routes in the Caspian
    Sea region, in order to increase the energy security of consumers in Europe and
    the Middle East and to diversify the market opportunities for Kazakhstani exporters.
    With American support, Kazakhstan signed an agreement with Azerbaijan in June
    2006 to transport oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. For Kazakhstan,
    this agreement was necessary to safeguard its export markets due to Russia’s refusal
    to increase the transportation capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC)
    and the BTC’s capacity to handle increased production. \n\nSince 2006 Kazakhstan
    has been co-funding programs under USAID’s Economic Development Program jointly
    with USAID, demonstrating country’s interest in USAID’s expertise and support
    in developing small and medium enterprises, economic reforms, and regional trade.
    For the year 2014, programs targeting development of small businesses, foreign
    investment attraction and energy efficiency increase were allocated around $4.1
    million. Kazakhstan received approximately $2 billion of all-agency funding from
    the US between 1993 and 2012.\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev met with US Energy
    Secretary Rick Perry and State Agency for Foreign Private Investment President Ray
    Washburn on January 16, 2018 during his official visit to the US. The sides discussed
    Kazakhstan-US cooperation in the oil and gas sector and spoke about the implementation
    of projects at the Tengiz and Kashagan oilfields. President Nazarbayev also told

  title: Privacy Policy
  body: "This notice provides the Embassy of Kazakhstan in the United States (the
    Embassy) privacy policy regarding the nature, purpose, use, and sharing of any
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collected via this website. Our privacy
    policy explains our information practices when you provide PII to us, whether
    collected online or offline, or when you visit us online to browse, obtain information,
    or conduct a transaction. PII may include: your name, email, mailing and/or home
    address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally. We
    do not require you to register or provide personal information to visit our website.\n\nThe
    PII you provide on the Embassy website will be used only for its intended purpose.
    We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the Privacy
    Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002, and the Federal Records Act.\n\n__Personally
    Identifiable Information__\n\nAs a general rule, the Embassy does not collect
    PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information
    to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving
    the Embassy your permission to use the information for the stated purpose. However,
    not providing certain information may result in the Embassy’s inability to provide
    you with the service you desire.\n\nIf you choose to provide us with PII on a
    Embassy website, through such methods as completing a web form or sending us an
    email, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or
    service you have requested or to respond to your message. The information we may
    receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.\n\n \n\nGenerally,
    the information requested by the Embassy will be used to respond to your inquiry
    or to provide you with the service you request. When this information is requested,
    the reasons for collecting it, a description of the Embassy’s intended use of
    the information, how to grant consent to use mandatorily provided information,
    and how to grant consent for other than statutorily mandated uses will be fully
    described in a separate customized “Privacy Notice.” This customized Privacy Notice
    will either appear on the web page collecting the information or be accessible
    through a hyperlink (link) prominently displayed immediately above or below the
    information request.\n\n \n\nEmail\n\n \n\nMany of our programs and websites allow
    you to send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to
    your inquiry. We will only send you general information via email. You should
    be reminded that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore,
    we suggest that you do not send sensitive personal data (such as your Social Security
    number) to us via email. If your intended email communication is very sensitive,
    or includes information such as your bank account, credit card, or Social Security
    number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail. Another alternative may be submission
    of data through a secure web page, if available.\n\n \n\nElectronic mail messages
    that meet the definition of records in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3101
    et seq.) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other Federal
    records. This means that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for
    varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition of Federal records.
    Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer needed.\n\n
    \n\nCategories of information the Embassy collects on its websites are further
    described below.\n\n \n\nAutomatically Collected Information\n\n \n\nWe collect
    and temporarily store certain information about your visit for use in site management
    and security purposes only. We collect and analyze this information because it
    helps us to better design our website to suit your needs. We may also automatically
    collect information about the web content you view in the event of a known security
    or virus threat. This information includes:\n\n \n\n1. The Internet domain from
    which you access our website (for example, “xcompany.com” if you use a private
    Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect from an educational
    domain);\n\n \n\n2. The Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique number for each
    computer connected to the Internet) from which you access our website;\n\n \n\n3.
    The type of browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome) used to access
    our site;\n\n \n\n4. The operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Unix) used to
    access our site;\n\n \n\n5. The date and time you access our site;\n\n \n\n6.
    The Universal Resource Locators (URLs), or addresses, of the pages you visit;\n\n
    \n\n7. Your username, if it was used to log in to the website; and\n\n \n\n8.
    If you visited this website from another website, the URL of the forwarding site.\n\n
    \n\nWe may share the above information with our employees or representatives with
    a “need-to-know” in the performance of their official duties, other Federal agencies,
    or other named representatives as needed to quickly process your request or transaction.
    This information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. Raw
    data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management
    purposes only. More information about how we share information can be found in
    our Privacy Act Systems of Records Notices.\n\n \n\nThird-Party Websites and Applications\n\n
    \n\nThe Embassy uses social media websites and other kinds of third-party websites.
    The Embassy uses social media websites to interact with foreign constituencies
    and engage in public diplomacy worldwide. Social media websites are used to publicize
    embassy and Embassy events, and engage with members of the public in foreign countries.
    The Embassy also uses web measurement and customization technologies to measure
    the number of visitors to our websites and their various sections and to help
    make our websites more useful to visitors. In such cases, the third-party application
    may request an email address, username, password, and geographic location (e.g.,
    State, region, or ZIP code) for account registration purposes. The Embassy of
    State does not use third-party websites to solicit and collect PII from individuals.
    Any PII passively collected (i.e., not solicited) by the third-party website will
    not be transmitted or stored by the Embassy; no PII will be disclosed, sold or
    transferred to any other entity outside the Embassy, unless required for law enforcement
    purposes or by statute.\n\n \n\nThe Embassy uses various types of online surveys
    to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors. Primarily,
    kazakhembus.com uses the ForeSee Results’ American Customer Satisfaction Index
    (ACSI) online survey on an ongoing basis to obtain feedback and data on visitors’
    satisfaction with the kazakhembus.com website. This survey does not collect PII.
    Although the survey invitation pops up for a random sample of visitors, it is
    optional. If you decline the survey, you will still have access to the identical
    information and resources at the kazakhembus.com site as those who do take the
    survey. The survey reports are available only to kazakhembus.com managers and
    other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. The
    Embassy may use other limited-time surveys for specific purposes, which are explained
    at the time they are posted.\n\nThe Embassy retains the data from the ACSI survey
    results as long as needed to support the mission of the kazakhembus.com website.\n\nInformation
    Collected for Tracking and Customization (Cookies)\n\nA cookie is a small file
    that a website transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information
    about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the
    information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website
    can request it. There are two types of cookies:\n\n \n\nSession: Session cookies
    last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the
    cookie is deleted. Websites may use session cookies for technical purposes such
    as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize
    your preferences for interacting with the site.\nPersistent: Persistent cookies
    are saved on a user’s hard drive in order to determine which users are new to
    the site or are returning, and for repeat visitors, to block recurring invitations
    to take the ForeSee satisfaction survey.\n \n\nIf you do not wish to have session
    or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn cookies off in your
    browser. You will still have access to all information and resources at Embassy
    websites. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some Embassy
    websites. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie usage
    at all other websites you visit as well.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe Embassy takes the
    security of all PII very seriously. We take precautions to maintain the security,
    confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this site. Such
    measures include access controls designed to limit access to the information to
    the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ various security
    technologies to protect the information stored on our systems. We routinely test
    our security measures to ensure that they remain operational and effective.\n\nWe
    take the following steps to secure the information we collect:\n\nEmploy internal
    access controls to ensure that only personnel who have access to your information
    are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.\nTrain appropriate
    personnel on our privacy and security policies and compliance requirements.\nSecure
    the areas where we retain paper copies of the information we collect online.\nPerform
    regular backups of the information we collect online to ensure against loss.\nUse
    technical controls to secure the information we collect online including, but
    not limited to:\nSecure Socket Layer (SSL)\nEncryption\nFirewalls\nPassword protections\nPeriodically
    test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance.\nEmploy
    external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized access by outsiders
    that attempt to “hack” into, or cause harm to, the information contained in our
    systems.\n \n\nWe hold our contractors and other third-party providers to the
    same high standards that we use to ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity
    of personal information they may have access to in the course of their work completed
    on behalf of the Embassy.\n\nInteraction With Children Online\n\nThe Embassy is
    committed to the protection of children’s online privacy. The Children’s Online
    Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about
    children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian
    is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from
    a child under age 13. If a Embassy website intends to collect information about
    children under 13 years old, COPPA-required information and instructions will
    be provided by the specific web page that collects information about the child.
    The web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will
    see it, and how long it will be kept.\n\nVisiting Other Websites\n\nOur website
    contains links to international agencies, private organizations, and some commercial
    entities. These websites are not within our control and may not follow the same
    privacy, security, or accessibility polices. Once you link to another site, you
    are subject to the policies of that site. All Federal websites, however, are subject
    to the same Federal policy, security, and accessibility mandates.\n\n \n\n \n\n "

  title: Literature
  body: "Abay Kunanbaev (1845-1904). Abay was born in 1845 at the bottom of the Chingiz
    Mountain in the today's Abai district (former Karkaraly) located in Eastern Kazakhstan
    region (formerly, the Semipalatinsk region).\n\nHe was a well-known Kazakh poet,
    a great thinker, composer, philosopher, the founder of written Kazakh literature,
    and its first classic.\n\nThe heritage he left his nation is rich in songs and
    poems, translations and prose. His translations of the poetry written by Russian
    writers and poets such as Pushkin, Lermontov, and Krylov became the national patrimony
    of Kazakhstan. He translated the works of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron into Kazakh
    language.\n\nAbai Kunanbaev is the Shakesphere of Kazakh literature.  His [Book
    of Words](http://kazakhworld.com/abai-kunanbaev-book-of-words/), «Kara Sozder»,
    created by the great thinker constitute an ethnic philosophical work. This creation
    of his is an exploration of Kazakh national life in the second half of the 19th
    century. He influenced social affairs in the country where he lived.\n\n<iframe
    src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/abai-slides/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\"
    frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nHe also participated in the governing of the country
    and played a certain role in trying to solve complicated problems justly.\n\nThe
    name of Abai is known worldwide just as Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin are well-known
    in many countries, because his great words became a spiritual patrimony of not
    only one nation, but of the entire humankind.\n\nAbay's main contribution to Kazakh
    culture and folklore lies in his poetry, which expresses great nationalism and
    grew out of Kazakh folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing
    the nomadic habits of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abay's lifetime,
    however, a number of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred.
    Russian influence continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational
    possibilities as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether
    Russian, Western or Asian. Abay Qunanbayuli steeped himself in the cultural and
    philosophical history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense, Abay's
    creative poetry affected the philosophical thinking of educated Kazakhs.\n\nThe
    leaders of the Alash Orda movement saw him as their inspiration and spiritual
    predecessor.\n\nContemporary Kazakh images of Abay generally depict him in full
    traditional dress holding a dombra (the Kazakh national instrument). Today, Kazakhs
    revere Abay as one of the first folk heroes to enter into the national consciousness
    of his people. Almaty State University is named after Abay, so is one of the main
    avenues in the city of Almaty. There are also public schools with his name.\n\nContent

  body: "Strong evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5919/1332\">Botai
    civilization</a> was the first to domesticate the horse. Research and analysis
    of escavated pottery and other artifacts has coalesced the opinion that the ancient
    inhabitants of what is modern-day Kazakhstan used horses to aid them with their
    day-to-day lives.  \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/embeds/horse-culture/\"
    width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n##
    Significance of the Horse in Kazakh Culture\n\nWhile the people of the Great Steppe
    had tamed horses thousands of years ago, the horse, its symbolism and history
    are woven into the fabric of Kazakh culture and modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\nThe
    world cultural community recognizes the unique and special role equines have in
    Kazakh culture. UNESCO has included the __traditional Spring Festive Rites of
    Kazakh horse breeders__ on the Representative List of the [Intangible Cultural
    Heritage (ICH) of Humanity](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-spring-festive-rites-of-the-kazakh-horse-breeders-01402).
    \n\nPreceded by year-long preparations, the the Spring Festive Rites of Kazakh
    Horse Breeders include: \n\n- __Biye baylau__ (tethering mares), the ancient first
    milking rite encompassing the separation of mares and foals from the herds, milking
    the mares and celebrating with songs, dances and games. \n- __Ayghyr kosu__ (the
    stallion’s marriage), a rite for adjoining stallions in herds to commence a new
    breeding season. \n- __Kymyz muryndyk__ the opening of the Spring season's Kymyz
    sharing rite and marks the season's production and sharing among other families.
    Kymyz, pronounced \"koumiss\", is a fermented mare's milk beverage. \n\n<div class=\"d-flex

    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
    picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Sayis - National
    Horse Racing Games\n- __Kokpar__\nThis game consists of two teams of horse riders.
    The objective is for the team to gather a goat carcass and bring it to their part
    of the playing field, past a designated line. Each time tries to do this as many
    times as possible to gain points.\n- __Audaryspak__\n  The objective of this game
    is quite simple: two horsemen must wrestle and attempt to push each other off
    of his saddle. \n- __Kyz kuu__ \n  In this game, a horseman tries to catch a girl
    on a horse galloping at full speed. He has to do this before she reaches the finish
    line. If he catches her, he may kiss her. But, if he loses, the girl must catch
    him and whip him (playfully, of course).\n- __Kumys-alu__\n  This game is quite
    easy to grasp, too. A horseman must gallop on his horse and attempt to pick up
    coins scattered on the ground. The rider gets to keep the coins he gathers as
    a prize.\n- __Tenge alu__ \n- __Zhaby atu__ \n- __Zhorga zharys__"

  title: Government
  body: "Kazakhstan is a constitutional republic. \n<img id=\"right-to-vote\" src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/img/elections/right-to-vote.png\"
    class=\"img-fluid qazio-image-embed mx-auto\">\n\n\nSince its independence from
    the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has consistently moved towards a stable,
    democratic transition, which resulted in the establishment of a secular constitution
    in 1995. The constitution, modeled after Western models of the separation of powers,
    outlines the responsibilities of the executive, legislative and judicial branches.
    The executive power is under the President, the Government and the Ministries.
    The Senate and the Majlis control legislative powers. Lastly, the Constitutional
    Council and the Supreme Court control judicial power.\n\n<img id=\"alignment-with-osce\"
    style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.qazaqstan.io/assets/img/kz/osce-alignment.png\"
    class=\"img-fluid qazio-image-embed mx-auto\">\n\n__President__\n\nThe President
    of the Republic elected through a direct, popular vote for a five-year term. The
    Constitution enables the President to appoint the Prime Minister, with Parliament’s
    approval. The President may propose constitutional amendments, veto laws, and
    dissolve Parliament during a national crisis. The President is entrusted by the
    Parliament all legislative powers with a majority of two thirds of both chambers.
    He has the right to veto laws, which can only be countered by a majority of two
    thirds of each chamber. The President has the authority as the Supreme Commander
    of the armed forces to make final decisions on national security and defense.\n\n__Parliament__\n\nThe
    bicameral Parliament is composed of the Senate and the Mazhilis. The Senate includes
    forty seven deputies. All fourteen regions, plus the cities of Astana and Almaty,
    elect two representatives to serve for six-year terms, with half of the Senate
    up for election every three years. The President appoints the remaining fifteen
    deputies. The Majilis, with 107 members, makes up the lower house of the legislative
    branch. 98 members are elected by proportional representation to serve five-year
    terms, and the Assembly of Peoples of Kazakhstan chooses nine members.\nThe [Assembly
    of Peoples of Kazakhstan](https://assembly.kz/en/) gathers prominent representatives
    from the country’s 140 ethnic groups. The Assembly’s nine representatives in the
    Parliament are responsible for representing the interests of the other 373 members
    of the Assembly of Peoples.\n\nThe Parliament has the right to take initiatives but
    those having budgetary implications must be submitted to the Government for approval.
    Proposed bills are first approved by at least two-thirds of the Majilis before
    they are sent to the Senate for consideration. If at the bill is approved by at
    least two-thirds of the Senate within sixty-days, the bill is sent to the President
    for his signature. However, in case they are rejected, they are returned to a
    second review by the Majilis who must then vote by a majority of two thirds before
    returning the bills again to the Senate. The Parliament also approves the President’s
    appointment of the Prime Minister.\n\nAt the regional level, Maslikhats are local
    executive bodies elected in each of the fourteen regions for two-year terms through
    direct elections based on the principles of universal suffrage. Maslikhats are
    in charge of social issues and under the supervision of “Akims”, who are regional
    prefects appointed by the president.\n\n<img id=\"women-in-politics-in-kazakhstan\"
