{% capture url %}{% comment %}

This file should be used as a "wrapper" for various URLs
in the site. If a given URL is relative to the site directory,
then it should have the baseurl prepended to it. However, this
will break URLs that link to another website or domain. Since
the content is mixed, simply assuming that all URLs are in one
format or another could cause issues.

To use this file, simply include it when declaring an anchor or
img element, as follows:

<a href="{% include util/url.html url='https://example.com/' %}">Go Somewhere</a>

{% endcomment %}
{% if include.url contains '//' %}
{{ include.url }}
{% else %}
{{ include.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}
{% endif %}
{% endcapture %}{{ url | strip_newlines }}
