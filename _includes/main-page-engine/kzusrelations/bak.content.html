    <p> In recognizing the growth of the relationship between the United States and Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991, Presidents Trump and Nazarbayev resolved to strengthen cooperation on political and security issues, trade and investment, and people-to-people relationships through regular high-level meetings within the framework of an Enhanced Strategic Partnership Dialogue.  The two leaders committed to address shared challenges in Central Asia through regional formats, such as the C5+1 dialogue (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan + the United States), and welcomed future Afghan participation in C5+1 projects.  They resolved to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan, and to pursue initiatives fostering greater political and economic cooperation in the region.  The two leaders pledged to deepen their cooperation against violent extremism and international terrorism, while respecting the rule of law and human rights.</p>

  <p>On September 26-29, 2006, during the visit of President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev to Washington, he and then-President George W. Bush adopted a Joint Statement, which defined further prospects for the Kazakhstan-American relations, including strengthening of the strategic partnership through the intensification of strategic dialogues on energy, military cooperation, trade, investment and democratization. The document declares the US support for Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO and excluding Kazakhstan from the Jackson–Vanik amendment.</p>

  <p>After gaining its independence from the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan incorporated the principles of the UN’s Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which includes rule of law in Kazakhstan, into its founding documents. Progress in installing rule of law in Kazakhstan is evidenced by Kazakhstan’s work to reform its post-Soviet criminal code and criminal procedure code.</p>

  <p>Kazakhstan has worked with the US to advance the country’s capabilities to tackle these threats and ensure regional stability since becoming independent and has grown to be a recognized leader in regional security cooperation. The country has supported stabilization activities in Afghanistan and fought the common regional security threats, including nuclear proliferation, terrorism, trafficking in persons, narcotics, and organized crime as well as the newly emerging ones - climate change, food security, and water security. Its efforts have contributed to stability, peace and economic prosperity of the neighboring countries.</p>

  <h2 class="h4 mb-4">Nuclear Threat Reduction<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#us-ntr" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h2>
<p>Nuclear threat reduction is a cornerstone of US-Kazakhstan efforts to ensure regional stability. With a significant support from the US the country voluntarily destructed 1,300 nuclear warheads inherited from USSR under the Cooperative Threat Reduction Initiative, initiated by Senators Nunn and lugar. Kazakhstan now takes an active approach to promoting nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, as well as control, accounting and physical security of nuclear material. Kazakhstan is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone (CANWFZ). Kazakhstan is an active partner nation in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, which aims to strengthen the global capacity to prevent, detect and respond to nuclear terrorism. With a strong support of the US, Kazakhstan is now in the final stages of negotiating the terms of its hosting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear fuel bank. This bank will prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons by allowing countries to purchase fuel rather than setting up their own enrichment plants.

  </div>

   <p>Kazakhstan has assumed a critical leadership role in supporting US operations in fighting the common threats to security and stability in the region. In 2003, Kazakhstan sent military engineers to assist operations of the U.S. coalition in Iraq. Over five years, nine contingents totaling 290 Kazakh peacekeeping troops were rotated through Iraq. The troops carried out various missions including humanitarian assistance operations, convoy security, perimeter and base defense, quick reaction force duties, traffic control point operations, water purification, and demining. In fact, Kazakhstani forces dismantled nearly five million mines and explosives during their tenure in the Iraq. Kazakh doctors, together with their Iraqi colleagues and counterparts from other countries, provided medical assistance to more than 500 Iraqis, as well.</p>

      <p>Kazakhstan has made strides in fighting organized crime and terrorism. The country annually hosts Steppe Eagle joint counter-terrorism and peacekeeping exercises between Kazakh, US and NATO forces. Thanks to these exercises and the military training assistance Kazakhstan receives, it has developed forces that are capable of working with NATO as well as protect pipelines and other sensitive energy infrastructures of the country from potential attacks. Moreover, the US helped Kazakhstan strengthen its naval capabilities. These efforts confirm Kazakhstani government’s commitment to establish strong defense and security ties with the Western Allies.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mb-4">Foreign Direct Investment<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#us-fdi" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h2>
      The US is the fourth biggest foreign direct investor in Kazakhstan. Since 1993 the US has invested $ 25 billion in foreign direct investment. Between 2005 and 2013 the US was the second largest investor in the Kazakh economy, with majority of investment targeting the energy and mining sectors.

      Kazakhstan annually hosts various investment and trade-economic events, where Kazakhstani government officials and business leaders present current and future investment opportunities open to US investment and establish frameworks for future cooperation with US businesses. During the investment road shows  in 2012, GlaxoSmithKline, Innovaro,  Transcosmos have signed memorandums of understanding with Kazakh businesses. During Kazakhstan-US Convention in 2013 the Government has officially presented EXPO-2017 and its opportunities  for American energy companies.

      Kazakhstan has worked with the US to develop into a prosperous market that embraces free-market competition. Under the framework of the annual bilateral consultations (ABC), founded in 2010, that has been elevated to Strategic Partnership Dialogue in 2012, Kazakhstan and the Obama Administration focus on creation of favorable conditions for the development of investment and trade as well as economic development more broadly. The US has pledged to support Kazakhstan in its effort to obtain the WTO membership and to deepen trade and investment ties, particularly in the sectors prioritized by Kazakhstan Strategy 2050.

      Kazakhstan works closely with the United States to support its leadership role in economic development efforts in the Central Asia region. Together with Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan the countries established the United States-Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework (TIFA) in 2004. In 2014, at the 9th Council Meeting, the countries focused on advancing accession of the countries into WTO, customs, investment, standards, and sanitary measures coordination, as well as procurement.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mb-4">Energy Partnership<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#us-energypart" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h2>


  <p>The United States pays great attention to energy cooperation and has supported Kazakhstan in its efforts to increase its role in ensuring global energy security. The Energy Partnership Commission that was established in 2003, plays an important role in coordinating energy cooperation between the countries. At the 10th Annual Meeting of the Commission in 2014 the countries agreed to continue promoting cooperation in four broad areas: nuclear security, hydrocarbon resources, renewable energy and energy efficiency, and electric power. In the context of Kazakhstan’s plan to transition towards Green Economy, the countries have established a permanent expert dialogue and advanced implementation of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean energy projects.

  The US has actively promoted diversification of pipeline export-routes in the Caspian Sea region, in order to increase the energy security of consumers in Europe and the Middle East and to diversify the market opportunities for Kazakhstani exporters. With American support, Kazakhstan signed an agreement with Azerbaijan in June 2006 to transport oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. For Kazakhstan, this agreement was necessary to safeguard its export markets due to Russia’s refusal to increase the transportation capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and the BTC’s capacity to handle increased production.

  Since 2006 Kazakhstan has been co-funding programs under USAID’s Economic Development Program jointly with USAID, demonstrating country’s interest in USAID’s expertise and support in developing small and medium enterprises, economic reforms, and regional trade. For the year 2014, programs targeting development of small businesses, foreign investment attraction and energy efficiency increase were allocated around $4.1 million. Kazakhstan received approximately $2 billion of all-agency funding from the US between 1993 and 2012.</p>

  <p>Another prominent initiative is the Science and Technology Commission which was launched June 24-25, 2013, in Astana by the U.S. State Department and the Ministry of Education and Science of Kazakhstan. By creating a dialogue platform with several working groups (biomedical partnership, disease control, peer review, innovations, etc.) Kazakhstan and the Unites States affirm their commitment to strengthen scientific and technical cooperation between scientists, engineers, and students at research institutes and in the private sector.

  In addition to the Science and Technology Commission, the United States welcomes Kazakhstan’s climate change initiatives such as the "Green Bridge Initiative" officially presented during “RIO+20” UN Conference and “EXPO-2017”, where the U.S. will be hosting its own pavilion. The United States highly appreciates the decision of Kazakhstan to host the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) headquarters office in Astana.</p>
