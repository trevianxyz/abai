  </p>This course provides students with a general knowledge of the current spoken and written Kazakh Language. It familiarizes students with the Kazakh alphabet, common phrases used in real-life conversations and daily routines. Kazakh is spoken as a first or second language by roughly 8 million people throughout Central Asia and in Kazakhstan. Speaking some Kazakh is an asset to foreign nationals who spend time in Kazakhstan: investors, diplomats, aid workers and workers in the extractive and commercial space industries.
