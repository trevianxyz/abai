    Cultural history is a powerful unifying force for Kazakhs and all Turkic peoples. Central to 'being Kazakh' is an deep intimacy with the land -- the Great Steppe. Kazakh ethnonational identity is rooted in Nomadic life and survival on the steppe and a mindufulness of their ancestral legacies. The Great Steppe is comprised equally of complexity and simplicity and is strong force for all citizens.
<br>
    <b>Elbasy Kazakhstan's First President Nursultan Nazarbayev</b> called on all Kazakhs to respect and study Great Steppe history and to draw on it for strength and guidance. But he also called for a scientific approach to be applied to the study of the Great Steppe. Elbasy provided seven core facets that comprise Great Steppe and what it means to be Kazakh and Kazakhstani.
