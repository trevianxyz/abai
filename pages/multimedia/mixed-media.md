## Abai in ASCII Art 
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the printable characters defined by the [ASCII Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). ASCII art includes ANSI art, a computer art form that was widely used at one time on BBSes. It is similar to ASCII art, but constructed from a larger set of 256 letters, numbers, and symbols â€” all codes found in [IBM code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437), often referred to as extended ASCII and used in MS-DOS and Unix environments. ASCII art technique is widely used by artists, hobbysts, hackers. - [Tetoki](https://www.tetoki.eu/asciiart/)

### Why present Abai as ASCII art? 
Abai's words and music remain popular in their own, and Abai's image transcends generations and is an influence on the classical and pop culture genres throughout Kazakhstan and the Turkic world. ASCII Standard is a many decades-old encoding language that remains in use and influential in electronic communications today. We think ASCII art effectively presents the dichotomy of Abai's legacy: a classical force that is a heavy influence on the modern zeitgist. ASCII art gives strong visualization to the fact that ASCII and Abai are inextricable from their modern applications. And because we think ASCII art looks cool.
