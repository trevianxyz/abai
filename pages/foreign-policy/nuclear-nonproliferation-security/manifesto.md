On March 31, 2016, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev joined 50 world leaders at the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C.

In a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, President Nazarbayev raised awareness to the the most pressing task for the leaders this century: eliminating the threat of a third world war.

The end of the Cold War marked a time of hope that the mistrust that had divided our world would give way to a new era of peace, stability and cooperation. But the danger now, a generation later, is that this historic opportunity is being squandered.

President Nazarbayev's strongly worded Manifesto: “The World. The 21st Century” is a challenge to his global counterparts to commit to peace and dialogue.

Without such action, the President said the world was facing a real risk of plunging again into global conflict.
