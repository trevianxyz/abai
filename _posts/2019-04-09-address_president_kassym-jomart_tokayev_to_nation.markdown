__Dear compatriots!__

I appeal to each of you.

In accordance with the Constitution, __I have decided__ to hold __early elections__ of the President of Kazakhstan on __June 9, 2019__.

I consulted with Elbasy Nursultan Nazarbayev, as well as with Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, and the Prime Minister.

The decision was agreed upon by the Constitutional Council.

I met with the leaders of the parliamentary parties.

__The decision on early elections is important and necessary.__

Thanks to Elbasy, we have built a successful and widely respected nation. Kazakhstan has gained a worthy place in the international community. Our country plays an increasing role in global affairs.

This is a fateful moment for all of us.

The power in Kazakhstan has been transferred in a calm atmosphere in full accordance with the Constitution. This caused respect for Kazakhstan from the world community.

Since taking office, I made a trip across regions, so __I am aware of the mood of people__. I meet with the intelligentsia, labour communities, business people, investors and representatives of international organizations.

My conclusion is that we are on the right track. __Our wise nation is united. Our state, as the supreme value of our independence, is indispensable__.

Therefore, I firmly believe that early elections of the Head of State are a vital necessity.

In order to ensure __political and social consent__, confidently __move forward, solve the tasks__ of socio-economic development, __it is of vital importance to remove any uncertainty__.

Moreover, the situation in the world __is changing rapidly__ and unfortunately, we are facing new challenges ahead. We must confirm the __continuity, predictability and stability__ of our domestic and foreign policy. We shall continue working on the effective, successful implementation of __social programs and strategic course of Elbasy__.

This can be fulfilled only through direct expression of the __will of the people in the elections__.

Kazakhstan is a democratic state. And its President will be elected as per people's will.

In the capacity of Acting Head of State, I guarantee that it will be __free, transparent and fair elections!__

__This is my firm position!__

We are facing great challenges. I believe in the wisdom of our people.

__Dear compatriots!__

The folk wisdom says, "Where there is unity, there is creation" (Birlik Bar Zherde, Tirlik Bar!).

I am calling you to be fully responsible about the future elections.

The future of our country and the destiny of each family depend on your decision!
