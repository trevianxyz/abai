The Abai Center is excited to present a new online academy to expand access for everyone to a factual, unbiased and true representations of the Great Steppe through micro-courses that explore her myriad of histories, cultures, ancient civilizations and legacies.

The Great Steppe was once home to many nomadic civilizations and cultures, and these micro-courses explore influence on human development, and the lasting impact on the modern world that we live in. They look at what people ate, how they forged metals and tools, how the seemingly mundane cultural customs and traditions were actually critical to survival on the Great Steppe, their style of living and how they domesticated the horse and changed human history forever.

Abai was a consummate learner and musical storyteller: the ever-thinker, -student and -teacher. The Abai Center Academy aims to carry forward the torchlight for life-long learning that Abai lit with his words, strings and quill.

These micro-courses provide structured curricula from the works of archaeologists, historians, subject-matter experts, diplomats, peers, many more.  Multimedia brings the ancient past alive and social media samples mix in pop culture for wider, contemporary perspectives.

The Abai Academy is excellent resource for those who want to learn more about their ancestral homeland, for teachers seeking to bring pre-built courses into their classrooms, for those who wish to learn about Central Asia before travel or those conducting academic research.
