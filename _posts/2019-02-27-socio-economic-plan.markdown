A new program of the Nur Otan Party until 2030 titled “The Society of Welfare 10 Goals of the Decade” was adopted. It contains specific goals and projects that should become the foundation of the state social policy for the next three years and set the tone for the decade ahead.

The main priority of the new party program is to ensure a high standard of living for citizens and the development of Kazakhstan as a socially oriented state.
The new program will be implemented in three areas 1. Increasing income and supporting low-income segments of the population; 2. Addressing housing issues for citizens with low income and improving education and health care; 3. Integrated development of regions.
The Head of State also stressed that this year more than 45% of all expenses of the state budget were allocated to the social sphere. Funds from the National Fund of Kazakhstan will also be allocated in order to improve the quality of life and well-being of Kazakh citizens.

Based on this, President Nazarbayev set the following tasks before the Government of Kazakhstan
- to raise wages of low-paid public sector employees up to 30%;
- to raise the salary by an average of 25% for local workers of executive bodies who work directly with citizens at the district and regional levels.
- in order to expand the coverage of low-income families, especially those with many children, to increase the criterion for providing targeted assistance to 70% of the subsistence minimum;
- all procedures of social assistance assignment should be as simple as possible and turned into a proactive format;
- to increase the allowance to parents, guardians and families (persons) raising children with disabilities by 30%;
- to build more than 40,000 apartments for rent within the Nurly Zher program, mainly for low-income families with many children;
- to develop a preferential mechanism for the provision of housing loans at 2-3% per annum through the system of housing savings.
- to increase the expenditure on the public health service and primary health care from 40 to 60% of the total health care funding.
> As noted by the Head of State, “today, the competition of states is about the competition of people. Economic achievements and geopolitical victories are not of great value unless they lead to an increase in each person’s welfare. This is the main secret of prosperity and the formula for the sustainable development of states in the 21st century.”
