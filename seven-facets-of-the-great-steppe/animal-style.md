intro: "Our ancestors lived in complete harmony with the outside world and considered themselves an inseparable part of nature...The most striking element of their heritage, a reflection of the artistic originality and richness of spiritual content is the “art of animal style.” The use of images of animals in everyday life was a symbol of the interrelation of man and nature, pointing to the spiritual guides of the steppe people."
