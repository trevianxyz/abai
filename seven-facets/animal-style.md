intro: "Our ancestors lived in complete harmony with the outside world and considered themselves an inseparable part of nature...The most striking element of their heritage, a reflection of the artistic originality and richness of spiritual content is the “art of animal style.” The use of images of animals in everyday life was a symbol of the interrelation of man and nature, pointing to the spiritual guides of the steppe people."

Kazakh ancestors used the images of animals in everyday life to show a strong connection between people and nature, pointing to the spiritual guides of the Steppe people. These images were often produced with the use of the most advanced techniques of the time, including the smelting and casting of copper and bronze, and the complex manufacturing of gold sheets.

Many Kazakh tales are woven around animals, with domestic creatures like camels, horses, sheep and goats acting as man’s friends, and wild animals such as wolves, foxes, bears, tigers and snakes being enemies. Magical creatures appear to help fairytale heroes.
